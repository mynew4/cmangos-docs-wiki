They were only tested with Mac OS X 10.6.8 but should also work with 10.7. These steps won't work on higher versions without further tweaks. 1: Getting everything you need Privileges You must have access to an administrator account on your computer. Software tools In order to download, compile and install CMaNGOS and its tools, you will need the following software. All of them are free, though some may require you to register on the company website before downloading. All come with a standard Mac OS X installer which will greatly ease their installation and setting. Developers Tools (Xcode) You'll need them to compile the source files. They are provided to developers by Apple You can grab Xcode here: https://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/#xcode Don't forget to install the command line tools (Preferences>Download for the last version of Xcode) A C++11 compliant compiler See this guide on our wiki. Boost lib The network part of CMaNGOS rely on boost library. You need to get it and install/compile it from http://www.boost.org/users/download/. We will then assume that Boost in installed under /usr/local/boost/ . You will need to let your OS know where Boost lib directory is by running: $ DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/boost/lib:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH $ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH MySQL Community Database Server Where a great part of the data about the game server side will be stored. Link: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/?rz=gdl#downloads Of course, if you have a 64-bit Mac, install the 64-bit MySQL package Git Git comes with Xcode so you don't have to install it separately. If you want a newer version you can download it from http://git-scm.com/ CMake To configure compilation. Get it from here: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html Of course, if you have a 64-bit Mac, install the 64-bit CMake package. Once all these softwares are downloaded and installed on your Mac, you can move to the next step. 2. Building CMaNGOS - creating the world engine From now, we will assume that: all the building will be done in a directory named mangos into your home directory you will download CMaNGOS sources into a subdirectory of this mangos folder (which we will also name mangos) you will install your server also into subdirectory of this mangos directory (which will be named run) your game client is located in /Applications/World of Warcraft/ First, we will download all sources for CMaNGOS and scripts. Open Terminal and enter: $mkdir mangos && cd mangos $git clone git://github.com/cmangos/mangos-wotlk.git mangos or for TBC: $git clone git://github.com/cmangos/mangos-tbc.git mangos Or for classic: $git clone git://github.com/cmangos/mangos-classic.git mangos Once the download is finished, we create the directory where the CMaNGOS server will be installed: $mkdir run Now, we will prepare to build the server $cd mangos Download the source files for the scripts (allows NPC to cast more spells and do complex things, not mandatory but you definitely want them): $git clone git://github.com/scriptdev2/scriptdev2.git src/bindings/ScriptDev2 For TBC use instead: $git clone git://github.com/scriptdev2/scriptdev2-tbc.git src/bindings/ScriptDev2 For Classic use instead: $git clone git://github.com/scriptdev2/scriptdev2-classic.git src/bindings/ScriptDev2 We will now configure the compilation to tell cmake we want to install CMaNGOS server into the server directory we created earlier: $mkdir build && cd build $cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/mangos/run -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=~/toolchains/gcc-4.8.5/bin/gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=~/toolchains/gcc-4.8.5/bin/g++ -DBOOST_INCLUDEDIR=/usr/local/boost/include If everything is OK, we can compile: $make Note: If your computer's CPU is multicore, you can instead type $make -jN where N is your number of cores. For instance, compiling on a 4 cores CPU: $make -j4 You can use the same command option everytime you will see $make in this tutorial. If everything went OK, we can install the compiled files: $make install Finally, we will create the config files from their template files. $cd ~/mangos/run/etc/ $cp realmd.conf.dist realmd.conf $cp mangosd.conf.dist mangosd.conf $cp scriptdev2.conf.dist scriptdev2.conf 3. Extracting Maps and DBC - adding a world around the engine Now the server is built and installed, we will extract all the maps, objects, spells and others data from the game files. The CMaNGOS server will need them to shape the world around your characters. The extractor utility is provided with the CMaNGOS source files and we will build it: $cd ~/mangos/mangos $cd ./contrib/extractor $cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=i386 $make There now should be an new file named ad . This is the Map/DBC Extractor. We will extract the maps and the DBC files from the game data and put the extracted files where the freshly compiled server was installed. $cp ad /Applications/World\\ of\\ Warcraft/ $cd /Applications/World\\ of\\ Warcraft/ $chmod +x ad $./ad -f 0 -i /Applications/World\\ of\\ Warcraft/ -o . You can either remplace f 0 by f 1 , depending of the accuracy you want for the maps (but at the cost of larger file size). You should now have two new directories: dbc and maps inside your WoW client folder. By default, they need to be put where the server binaires are. If you want to use mmaps (for pathfinding and smoother creatures movements), you can go to step 4. If you don't want to use mmaps, you can move the dbc and maps to the server directory: $mv dbc maps ~/mangos/run/bin/ 4. Installing the vmaps (optional, but highly recommended) Vmaps are used by the server to determine if NPC can see/attack your characters, through walls for instance. This is also called LoS calculation (Line of Sight). We will extract the vmaps from the game data and then assemble them. CMaNGOS does not yet provide binaries for Mac but it does provide the source files, thus we will build our own binaries. First, we need to download and apply a patch written by evil-at-wow and myself: $cd ~/mangos/mangos (copy paste the command line below into Terminal) $curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cala/5784873/raw/0b06591d9aac800a2ede4b8ba4b15e586d5d789e/Fix%20extractors%20build%20for%20Mac%20OS%20X -o fix_extractors_for_os_x.patch $git apply fix_extractors_for_os_x.patch If everything went OK, you should not have any feedback and we need to commit (aka save the changes). $git commit -am \"Fix extractors build for Mac OS X\" Now the patch is applied, we can build the library allowing to extract from the game files: $cd dep/libmpq/ $./autogen.sh Some text will be displayed and should ends by Now you are ready to run ./configure . Let's do that: $./configure CC=\"gcc -arch x86_64\" CXX=\"g++ -arch x86_64\" CFLAGS='-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -D_LARGE_FILES=1 -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE=1' $make The compilation should take a few minutes, then we need to link the built library to the standard Mac OS X directory for third party libraries: $ln -s /usr/local/lib/libmpq.4.0.2.dylib /Users/yourusername/mangos/mangos/dep/libmpq/libmpq/.libs/libmpq.4.0.2.dylib $ln -s /usr/local/lib/libmpq.la /Users/yourusername/mangos/mangos/dep/libmpq/libmpq/libmpq.la We are now ready to build the vmaps extractor/assembler: $cd ../../contrib/vmapextractor/ $cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 $make When the compile process is done, a new file named vmapextractor should be in vmapextractor directory We copy to our game client directory for later use: $cp vmapextractor/vmapextractor /Applications/World\\ of\\ Warcraft Now, let's build the vmap assembler: $cd ../vmap_assembler/ $cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 $make When the compile process is done, a new file named vmap_assembler should be in the current directory. We need to copy it too to our game client directory: $cp vmap_assembler /Applications/World\\ of\\ Warcraft We can finally extract and assemble vmaps $cd /Applications/World\\ of\\ Warcraft $chown +x vmap_assembler vmapextractor Now, we create the directory where the vmaps will be extracted and we do the extraction: $mkdir buildings $./vmapsExtractor -d Data This should take a few (dozen of) minutes. Once all the vmaps are extracted, we need to assemble them: $mkdir vmaps $./vmaps_assembler buildings vmaps This will also take a few (dozen of) minutes. Once finished, we move the vmaps to the server repository and we clean the extracted data that we no longer need: $mv vmaps ~/mangos/run/bin/ $rm -R buildings 5. Installing the mmaps (optional) MovementMaps (mmaps) are used by the server to determine where a NPC can go (or not) with a fine precision: slopes, tree trunks, thin walls... It also enable the nice pathfinding with much better movement for creatures. We will extract the mmaps from the game data and previously extracted maps. CMaNGOS does not yet provide binary for Mac but it does provide the source files, thus we will build our own binary: $cd ~/mangos/mangos/contrib/mmaps/ $cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 $make When the compile process is done, a new file named MoveMapGen should be in the current directory. We need to copy it too to our game client directory: $cp MoveMapGen MoveMapGen.sh /Applications/World\\ of\\ Warcraft We can finally extract the mmaps $cd /Applications/World\\ of\\ Warcraft $chmod +x MoveMapGen* Now, we create the directory where the mmaps will be generated: $mkdir mmaps And finally, we generated the mmaps (be aware that it will take hours, litteraly): $./MoveMapGen.sh N Where N is the number of core you want to use to extract the mmaps ranging from 1 to 4. Several hours later, when the mmaps are generated, we move them to the server binay folder, along with the maps and DBC: $mv dbc maps mmaps ~/mangos/run/bin/ You have now complete all the steps that are specific to Mac OS X. For all the remaining steps (mainly configuration, database management and server startup), you can refer to the CMaNGOS Installation guide: Installation-Instructions Note: for MySQL, we advice using the very nice and free front end client: Sequel Pro http://www.sequelpro.com/","title":"Build CMaNGOS for Mac OS X"},{"location":"Build-CMaNGOS-for-Mac-OS-X/#1-getting-everything-you-need","text":"Privileges You must have access to an administrator account on your computer.

Versions There are three versions of CMaNGOS: Classic , The Burning Crusade , and Wrath of the Lich King . The fourth version, Cataclysm is currently not maintained. Each version consists of one core git repository and one database git repository (found under https://github.com/cmangos): Repo\\Version Classic TBC WotLK Core mangos-classic mangos-tbc mangos-wotlk DB classic-db tbc-db wotlk-db Note: When following this guide, you will sometimes have to pick the command/path appropriate to the version you would like to install. You will have to replace the VERSION part of them with classic , tbc or wotlk , i.e. if you are asked to got to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION and you are installing WotLK, you have to go to C:\\mangos\\mangos-wotlk . The screenshots will show the pathes for Classic version. Releases Compilation of the server core and extractor tool binaries is optional. If you do not plan on changing the code yourself, you can download the precompiled binaries from the release pages of the core repositories on Github. Here are the links to the download pages: https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-classic/releases https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-tbc/releases https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-wotlk/releases We will provide more information about how to setup a server with released files when it will be possible. More Information This guide is intended only for Windows and provides one of many ways to setup a CMaNGOS server. You can find a more detailed installation guide (including alternative programs, Linux/Mac setup, etc.) in the Wiki . If you get stuck you can find us here: - http://cmangos.net (forum) - Discord: https://discord.gg/nSaXpCn - #cmangos channel on irc.rizon.net - you can create an new issue in our Github bug tracker 32 or 64 Bit? This section will most likely not be of any concern to most people, as it is highly unlikely they have 32-bit hardware/OS. If your system is very old and you want to make sure you run a 64-bit version of Windows, press WinKey+Pause (or navigate to the System settings in the Control Panel). You should see a row named System type in the list there, which should read 64-bit Operating System . If that is the case, you can ignore the rest of this section and follow the guide to the letter. 32-bit/64-bit refers to the instruction set architecture (ISA) of your computers central processing unit (CPU). Generaly speaking, 64-bit processors can run instructions sets (parts of a program) that are twice as big and the program therefore runs faster. They are however able to run 32-bit programs as well, while 32-bit processors are unable to run 64-bit programs. The same goes for operating systems. If you have a 64-bit processor but a 32-bit Windows version, you will not be able to run 64 bit programs. In the context of this guide, that means if you have either a 32-bit processor or Windows version, you will have to adjust the instructions given here to that fact. You will have to download/install 32-bit programs and set it as target architecture during compilation. You can usually recognise the correct link/file by a part of its name that will read something like 32 , 32bit , x86 , etc. If you run into problems while compiling or running a 32-bit version of CMaNGOS, you can find information about how to contact the team in the above section . Note: While x86 refers to the 32-bit architecture, x86_64 or x86-64 refers to the 64-bit architecture (read \"I can only process 32-bit\" vs. \"I can process both 32-bit and 64-bit\"). Toolchain These are programs you will need to setup the database and compile the core. This section will explain where to download and how to install them. If not otherwise noted in the programs installation instructions, the default settings apply. After downloading them all into a separate folder, it should look something like this: Boost Go to: http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/ Select a version number not ending in _bX (those are beta versions), e.g. click 1.64.0 . (Confirmed working as of 2017-12-30. There have been problems reported with version 1.66. ) Download the executable file containing msvc-14.1-64 , e.g. boost_1_64_0-msvc-14.1-64.exe . (MSVC-14.1 is the Visual Studio 2017 C++ compiler, 64 stands for the 64 bit architecture) Execute the downloaded file. During the installation you will be asked to set the installation path, if you change it, remember it. It is needed in the next step. Add the BOOST_ROOT environment variable ( Note: You might have to relog/restart afterwards, so every program can see this variable): Press WinKey+Pause (or navigate to the System settings in the Control Panel). Click on Advanced system settings . Click on Environment Variables . Click on the bottom New button (Note: there are two, we need the one under System variables ). As Variable name enter BOOST_ROOT , as Variable value enter the path you installed boost to ( C:\\local\\boost_X_XX_X by default, depending on which version you downloaded). CMake Go to: https://cmake.org/download/#latest Download the Windows win64-x64 Installer (currently cmake-3.8.2-win64-x64.msi ) and install it. Git Go to: https://git-scm.com/download/win Confirm the download if it is the architecture you want (32 or 64 bit). Otherwise abort and select the correct version. During installation make sure the following options are checked: Git Bash Here: Use Git from the Windows Command Prompt: Use MinTTY: MySQL Go to: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ Download the web installer. If you have no internet during setup you can download the full 400 MB installer instead. Start the installer and select Setup Type Custom : Add MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench : If there are missing requirements reported on the next page, select them and click Execute if possible: You will have to define the MySQL Root Password . This will be the admin password to your MySQL server so make sure to remember it! The root user will have access to all databases. We will create another user later in the process which will only have access to CMaNGOS databases. After the installation has finished, start the MySQL Workbench program and click on the Local instance button. In the popup that opens, set the checkbox and enter your root password. Add the MySQL servers path to the Path environment variable: ( Note: You might have to relog/restart afterwards, so every program can see the updates to the variable) Press WinKey+Pause (or navigate to the System settings in the Control Panel). Click on Advanced system setting . Click on Environment Variables . In the bottom part of the new window (under System variables ) look for the variable called Path , select it, and click on Edit .

Select the Variable value field and make sure the cursor is at the end of the field and no text is selected (press EndKey or ArrowRightKey ). Add the path where your MySQL server was installed, prefixed by a semi-colon (by default ;C:\\Program Files\\MySQL\\MySQL Server 5.7\\bin ) and save the changes by clicking OK . Notepad++ Notepad++ is completely optional. It is an improved version of the text editor that comes with Windows. You will have to edit a few files during installation, which you can do with the standard editor, but it is recommended doing it with Notepad++, as it has some handy features: Open files from the context (right-click) menu: Recognises Linux style line endings. (Windows apparently thinks it is a typewriter and uses two symbols, CR and LF - c arriage r eturn and l ine f eed - for new lines instead of just LF like Linux does. This is why some files mysteriously appear to be written in one line.) Line numbers. Open multiple files at once. Remembers opened files and unsaved changes between sessions. Go to: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/ Download (32bit recommended since it has more plugins available) and install it. Make sure Context Menu Entry option is enabled: Visual Studio Go to: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ Under Visual Studio Community 2017 click on Free Download . Open the installer. When asked to select Workloads, check Desktop development with C++ and then click Install : Start Visual Studio 2017 . You will be asked if you want to sign in, but it is not needed: In the next window, leave the Development Settings as they are (General), but feel free to select another theme: Close Visual Studio for now. Cloning the repositories A git repository is basically just a normal directory which contains some hidden files, that the git program (or some other program) can use to manage different versions of that directory. In this step we will \"clone\" the repositories from Github, which means creating an exact copy of them on your hard drive. Location You can basically follow this guide from any location on your hard drive. However, we will assume you have created an empty directory called mangos on your C drive: C:\\mangos . If you want to work in another location, you will have to adjust some of the provided commands/locations. We also assume you have installed the Git Bash Here and Edit with Notepad++ commands to the Windows context menu. Navigate to C:\\mangos in the Windows Explorer, Right-Click into the empty area and select Git Bash Here : A new window should open with two lines of text: user@device MINGW64 /c/mangos This line shows the active user and the working directory. You can ignore the MINGW64. $ This line is the command prompt. It waits for you to write a command and press Enter . FYI: Git Bash uses Linux style pathes, which means: - Pathes use / (forward slash) instead of \\ (backwards slash). - Your base directories are not the hard drive partitions, but the single \"root directory\" / , which contains all the hard drives (and some other stuff). So /c/ points to your C:\\ and /d/ points to D:\\ . - There is a shortcut to the users \"home\" directory, which is ~ . The Windows path hidden behind that is C:\\Users\\YourUserName . So if Git Bash says you are in ~/Desktop you are actually in C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\Desktop . - There are absolute pathes (starting with / or ~ ), and relative pathes (not starting with / or ~ ). Relative pathes point to a location relative to the working directory. Every directory contains a directory .. which points to its parent (the directory one step closer to the root directory), and a directory . which points to itself (executing binaries is prefixed with ./ ). - Use cd /absolute/path/to/something or cd relative/path/to/something to change your working directory. You can use cd .. to go one directory back, cd ../.. to go two directories back, etc. - When you are entering long path names, you can use the Tab key to auto-complete them. E.g. if you have already entered cd /c/man and then press Tab , the command prompt will autocomplete it to cd /c/mangos (as long as there are no other directories in /c/ that start with man ). - For more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing) Core Note: You need these files even if you use the precompiled binaries, since some of the database creation scripts are contained in this repository. This command creates a copy of the Github repository on your hard drive. Copy the command ( Ctrl+C ): git clone https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-classic.git git clone https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-tbc.git git clone https://github.com/cmangos/mangos-wotlk.git In the Git Bash window, Right-Click and select Paste , or press Shift+Insert (for historic reason the usual copy/paste keyboard shortcuts do not work in most command line interfaces). Press Enter to confirm the command. Wait for download to finish. Database Copy the command: git clone https://github.com/cmangos/classic-db.git git clone https://github.com/cmangos/tbc-db.git git clone https://github.com/cmangos/wotlk-db.git Paste it in Git Bash and press Enter to confirm the command. Wait for download to finish. Compilation Configure CMake Start CMake. Set source directory to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION and build directory to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\bin\\BuildDir (see screenshot). You will have to create the bin and BuildDir directories, if they do not exist. The bin directory is listed in the repositories .gitignore file, which means you can change its content without git noticing it. If you choose another location inside the repository for building, you will break the update process (see Updating ). Click Configure In the popup window select the compiler version. If you followed this guide you have Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64 Make sure the BUILD_EXTRACTORS option is checked. Then click Generate . FYI: You can also activate the BUILD_PLAYERBOT option. Playerbot allows you to add other characters in your account as AI controlled bots that follow you around. Once the console at the bottom says Generating done , press Open Project , which should open Visual Studio. Compile with VS2017 Wait until the loading has finished (see bottom of the window). Choose Release and x64 at the dropdown menus on top. Press Ctrl+Shift+B , or Right-Click the topmost solution and select Build Solution . Wait until the output log shows the Build succeeded message. Assuming everything went well the binary-, library-, and configuration-files should now be in C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\bin\\x64_Release . Database Setup Creation Open MySQL Workbench and under MySQL Connections click on Local instance MySQL57 to establish a connection to the MySQL server. In the new tab that opens, click the Open SQL script file button: Navigate to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\sql\\create\\ and open the db_create_mysql.sql file. By running this script, a new user and three new databases will be created. Make sure you have no text selected in the editor, then click the left dash symbol. See the output at the bottom of the window to make sure there were no errors. Note: The new user is created in case people use their MySQL server for other stuff, as well as for security reasons. If you want to expose your server to the internet, it is highly recommended to change the password of this user in line 7 of the script (the string behind IDENTIFIED BY ). When closing the file, do not save the changes, or you will break the update process. FYI: If you want to run different versions of CMaNGOS at the same time (Classic/TBC/WotLK), you will have to rename the mangos DB (lines 1 and 9), the characters DB (lines 3 and 11) and the realmd DB (lines 5 and 13). The user creation (line 7) will need to be deactivated when creating a second or third server. Note that the middle dash button in Workbench executes only that part of the code, which has been selected in the editor, which might be helpful here. FYI: If you change neither password nor database names, and you do not wish to change the standard server configuration, you can skip the Configuration step later on. You should now see the new databases (referred to as Schemas in Workbench) on the left. If not, click the refresh button. Initialisation Double-Click the mangos database in the Schemas overview, so that its name is written bold. This marks the database as active, which means that table specific SQL commands will be run on this database. If the database name is not written in bold text after double-clicking it, restart Workbench and double-click again. Click the Open script file button above the editor: Execute the mangos.sql file found in C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\sql\\base\\ . (See output at bottom of window to know when it is finished.) Execute all scripts in the C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\sql\\base\\dbc\\original_data directory (currently DungeonEncounter.sql and Spell.sql ). Double-Click the characters database in the Schemas overview and execute the characters.sql file found in C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\sql\\base\\ . Double-Click the realmd database in the Schemas overview and execute the realmd.sql file found in C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\sql\\base\\ . You can now close Workbench. Filling Navigate to the C:\\mangos\\VERSION-db directory in the Windows Explorer, Right-Click into the empty area and select Git Bash Here . Enter ./InstallFullDB.sh and press Enter . In the Windows Explorer, Right-Click the newly created file InstallFullDB.config and select Edit with Notepad++ . Change the CORE_PATH variable to ../mangos-VERSION and save the file. FYI : The double dots mean we are going back one step in the directory tree, so it is assumed that the core repository has been cloned to the parent directory of the database repository. If you diverged from the guides steps adjust the relative path accordingly or use an absolute path (see Location section ). Note: If you changed the MySQL user name and/or password during the database creation step, you will have to change the USERNAME and/or PASSWORD variable here as well. Note: If you changed the database name mangos during the database creation step, you will have to change the DATABASE variable here as well. In Git Bash, enter the ./InstallFullDB.sh again, by pressing ArrowUp and Enter (it will now do something different, since the config file is present). Once the script finished you should see a message like this: Map Extraction FYI: This step deals with extracting terrain information from the client. This is used by the AI to generate correct movement. Four different data types are extracted. One of them, mmaps, is optional, because its extraction takes a long time (depending on your CPU, 30 minutes to several hours) . Mmaps are required for correct NPC movement though, so it is not advised to skip mmap extraction. This step is sometimes also needed when updating, but only if the extraction process has been changed (it is always needed when first installing). If the files need to be updated, the server will crash on startup and write information about this to the log file. Acquire a clean copy of the correct WoW client version (1.12.1/2.4.3/3.3.5). Note: It is recommended to do this step in a copy of the client directory, not the actual one you use for gaming, since some temporary files are created. If you use a copy you can just delete it after you are done. Your directory should look something like this (example from classic): Go to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\bin\\x64_Release\\Extractors (or the Extractors directory inside the directory you extracted the precompiled binaries to) and copy all the files to the client directory: Right-Click into the empty area and select Git Bash Here . Enter the command ./ExtractResources.sh and press Enter . The script will ask for settings, the recommended inputs are: y Number of your CPUs cores/threads. If you are unsure how many cores/threads your CPU has, Right-Click the Windows Taskbar, select Start Task Manager and switch to the Performance tab: On Windows 7 the number of graph windows you see under CPU Usage History corresponds with the number of cores/threads your CPU has. Example picture with 4 cores/threads: On Windows 10, look for the line saying Logical Processors : nothing (leave line blank and press Enter ) You will be prompted to confirm your settings. Press Enter to do so and go do something else. Like mentioned before, extraction takes a long time (depending on your CPU, 30 minutes to several hours). Wait until you see the command prompt again ( $ ). After extraction is finished, copy the dbc , maps , mmaps and vmaps directories to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\bin\\x64_Release (or the directory you extracted the precompiled binaries to). Finishing touches Configuration Note: If you have not changed the user password and database names during the database creation step above, and you do not plan on changing the standard configuration, then you can skip to running . FYI: You will have to start two binaries ( .exe files) to launch the server, the mangosd.exe and the realmd.exe (*the d stands for daemon ( d isk a nd e xecution mon itor). Both of the binaries read settings from a file which is passed to them by the -c <config-file> argument when starting them (see below ). The standard names for the configuration files are mangosd.conf.dist and realmd.conf.dist . They are copied to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\bin\\x64_Release when compiling (or contained in the zip file of the precompiled binaries). If you change the configuration, it is advised you rename the files to mangosd.conf and realmd.conf , so they will not be overwritten when updating . To do so, select the file and press F2 or Right-Click it and select Rename from the context menu. Then remove the .dist at the end, and press Enter . If you do not see the .dist ending when trying to rename, see the note below. Note: By default, Windows hides the part of the file name behind the last dot ( . ) in it (the file type extension). If you try to rename the files and do not see the .dist ending: Click on Organize in the top left and select Folder and search options . Uncheck the Hide extensions for known file types option and click OK or Apply . Try renaming again. After changing the file names, Right-Click the mangosd.conf and select Edit with Notepad++ . Change the values of LoginDatabaseInfo , WorldDatabaseInfo , and CharacterDatabaseInfo variables according to the changes you made (if you made any) during the database creation step and save the file with Ctrl+S . Right-Click the realmd.conf and select Edit with Notepad++ . Change the values of LoginDatabaseInfo variable according to the changes you made (if you made any) during the database creation step and save the file with Ctrl+S . Running In the Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\bin\\x64_Release (or the directory you extracted the precompiled binaries to). You have two options of doing the start up: Manual: Run from Git Bash Right-Click into the empty area and select Git Bash Here . Enter ./realmd.exe -c realmd.conf (or realmd.conf.dist if you skipped the Configuration step) and press Enter . Right-Click into the empty area and select Git Bash Here again. Enter ./mangosd.exe -c mangosd.conf (or mangosd.conf.dist if you skipped the Configuration step) and press Enter . Automatic: Create shortcuts containing the arguments Right-Click the mangosd.exe , chose either Send to->Desktop (create shortcut) or Create shortcut to create it in the same directory as the binaries. Right-Click the newly created shortcut and select Properties . At the end of the Target field, add -c mangosd.conf (or -c mangosd.conf.dist if you skipped the Configuration step). Repeat this for the realmd.exe , but add -c realmd.conf (or -c realmd.conf.dist if you skipped the Configuration step) at the end of the Target field instead. Start the the realmd.exe first, then the mangosd.exe . The latter will take some time to start, watch for the CMANGOS: World initialized line. (Depending on your configuration, it will be visible only for a split second. See next step on how to change that.) When first starting the server, the Windows Firewall might ask for permissions. If you want players to connect over the local network or the internet, enable both check boxes and click Allow access (for both realmd and mangosd binaries). Account Creation The mangosd.exe window will wait for commands. You can ignore the text scrolling through the window, it does not influence text input or deletion. FYI: If the scrolling text is bothering you, open the mangosd.conf file and change the value of the LogLevel variable to 0 (Mind the notes in the Configuration section about the config being overwritten during updates). Creating a new account: account create MyNewAccount MyPassword Setting the expansion the account is allowed to access: account set addon MyNewAccount 2 0: Classic (default value, this command is not needed when installing classic) 1: TBC 2: WotLK 3: Cata Setting the access level to ingame commands: account set gmlevel MyNewAccount 3 0: Player (default value) 1: Moderator 2: Game Master 3: Administrator After successfully entering these commands you are ready to start the client and log in to the server. Make sure the realmlist.wtf file in the client directory only contains set realmlist 127.0.0.1 before starting. If you want to save addresses of other servers, you can prefix their lines with // , like: set realmlist 127.0.0.1 //set realmlist someRealmd.somewhere Ingame commands There are many useful ingame commands. When ingame, open the chat prompt by pressing Enter , write .help and confirm by pressing Enter again. This will show a list of commands available to your account in the chat window. Many commands show further ingame documentation when called without arguments (e.g. .modify ). CMaNGOS has no dedicated documentation of these commands, if you want a list look through the source files, the database, or search the web for something like \"mangos gm commands\" (most commands are the same across open source servers). Shutdown In the mangosd.exe window, write server shutdown 1 (the number represents delay in seconds) and press Enter . In the realmd.exe window, press Ctrl+C . Updating Note: The git pull command used below might not work if you changed files inside the repositories (except for the bin directory inside the core repository and the InstallFullDB.config file in the database repository, because they are listed in the .gitignore file). If you have changed some files and the pull does not work, you can use the command git reset --hard to reset all the changes you made inside the repository (again excepting locations in the .gitignore file) and then git pull again. FYI: The default configuration files mangosd.conf.dist and realmd.conf.dist will be overwritten during the update. If you changed them, make sure you changed their name or file type too (see configuration section for more information). Released binaries To update the precompiled binaries, go to the release page on Github and download a fresh copy of the zip file (the release is automatically updated when there are new commits). Extract the content of the zip file into your current server directory, overwriting existing files. Now you need to update your database. Occasionally database updates get delivered through the core repository instead of the DB repository. The script used later to do the database update will search the core repository for updates, if its path is provided in the InstallFullDB.config file (see database filling section). Self compiled binaries In the Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\\mangos\\mangos-VERSION\\ . Right-Click and select Git Bash Here . Enter the git fetch command and wait until it is finished. It will look for updates in the repository on Github. If there are updates on origin/master , enter the git pull command to download them. Redo the steps of the Compilation section above. Database Update In the Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\\mangos\\VERSION-db\\ . Right-Click and select Git Bash Here . Enter the git fetch command and wait until it is finished. It will look for updates in the repository on Github. If there are updates on origin/master , enter the git pull command to download them. Enter the ./InstallFullDB.sh command and wait until it is finished. The necessary InstallFullDB.config file should still be present and correctly set from installing.","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"Detailed-installation-guide-for-Microsoft-Windows/#welcome","text":"Welcome to the C ontinued Ma ssive N etwork G ame O bject S erver! :tada: This step-by-step guide is intended to help people to install a CMaNGOS World of Warcraft server on their Windows computer.

If your system is very old and you want to make sure you run a 64-bit version of Windows, press WinKey+Pause (or navigate to the System settings in the Control Panel). You should see a row named System type in the list there, which should read 64-bit Operating System . If that is the case, you can ignore the rest of this section and follow the guide to the letter. 32-bit/64-bit refers to the instruction set architecture (ISA) of your computers central processing unit (CPU). Generaly speaking, 64-bit processors can run instructions sets (parts of a program) that are twice as big and the program therefore runs faster. They are however able to run 32-bit programs as well, while 32-bit processors are unable to run 64-bit programs. The same goes for operating systems. If you have a 64-bit processor but a 32-bit Windows version, you will not be able to run 64 bit programs. In the context of this guide, that means if you have either a 32-bit processor or Windows version, you will have to adjust the instructions given here to that fact. You will have to download/install 32-bit programs and set it as target architecture during compilation. You can usually recognise the correct link/file by a part of its name that will read something like 32 , 32bit , x86 , etc. If you run into problems while compiling or running a 32-bit version of CMaNGOS, you can find information about how to contact the team in the above section .

This Guide will help you for Windows or *nix (Ubuntu, Debian) and for all supported clients: Classic - TBC - WotLK. There is a guide with detailed screenshots on how to install on Windows for users unfamiliar with version control, compiling source code, etc. Instructions covering Mac OS X (10.6 & 10.7) specific steps are available here in addition of this guide. For other environments (like FreeBSD, ARM and similar) please consider our forum for assistance. If you run into issues during installation or need help understanding one of the following steps, please visit discord to look for solutions and ask questions. These Installation Instructions are expected to be current, so please read through every step again to ensure that you didn\u2019t skip or misunderstand something before going to the forums. If you are an absolute beginner to programming and compiling then you may want to go through the Beginner\u2019s Guide first. Addresses CMaNGOS: site | forum | git repositories | discord Classic-DB: forum | git repository TBC-DB: forum | git repository WOTLK-DB: forum | git repository YTDB: forum | svn repository PSDB: forum | svn repository Software requirements (Windows) Game client of: World of Warcraft Classic (1.12.x) for cmangos-classic World of Warcraft TBC (2.4.3) for cmangos-tbc World of Warcraft WotLK (3.3.5a) for for cmangos-wotlk Some tools: Git: Main Download Page . Select the \"Git Bash Here\" and \"Use Git Bash only\" options from the respective pages of the install Wizard in order to follow along with these instructions; otherwise, just use the default install options. Alternatively, you can install ( Git Extensions ) instead, which comes with Git, MySYSGit, and KDiff). CMAKE is now used to generate visual studio project file as it\u2019s are not provided anymore Download it from here . Visual C++ 2015 or newer: Visual Studio Downloads ( Visual Studio Community 2015 is recommended, but Express 2015 for Desktop will also do the job and is free, it is however not as good a choice for open source development as CE (Community Edition). Any MySQL server such as MySQL server community edition or XAMPP . (Note 2018-05-02: Do not use MySQL version 8.0 for now since build will fail on some queries. Use 5.7 until resolved) Any MySQL client (optional, for easy database access) such as MySQL Workbench or SQLyog SVN (very optional, for easy download of alternative (not directly supported by the cmangos team) databases (ytdb / psdb)): Tortoise SVN . An advanced text editor (optional) such as Notepad++ . Definitely not required but will make editing the configuration files much easier in later steps. You can find a video here of how to install Git, Visual Studio and CMAKE. There is a detailed installation guide on how to install on Windows . Software requirements (*nix) You will need Git, GCC, CMake, MySQL, Boost and a few libraries Ubuntu (12.04) sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc g++ automake git-core autoconf make patch libmysql++-dev mysql-server libtool libssl-dev grep binutils zlibc libc6 libbz2-dev cmake subversion libboost-all-dev Debian apt-get install grep build-essential gcc g++ automake git-core autoconf make patch cmake libmysql++-dev mysql-server libtool libssl-dev binutils zlibc libc6 libbz2-dev subversion libboost-all-dev Fedora dnf install git cmake gcc patch autoconf mariadb-server mariadb-devel libtool zfstream gcc-c++ subversion boost-devel Note: installing boost-devel has not been tested yet. Essentials CMaNGOS is the server, also called \"core\", which manages all the game inquiries and accesses your SQL Database to get the information needed. ScriptDev2 is an optional library which contains C++ scripts that, when added to CMaNGOS, handles special events, quests, encounters and bosses. AS OF 11/1/2015 ScriptDev2 HAS BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THE \"CORE\" ACID stands for \"Advanced Creature Intelligence Database\". It is an optional SQL database that handles regular mobs and bosses. ACID and ScriptDev2 complement each other and you should use both. ACID is usually already included in the database shipped by the database providers. AS OF 10/2016 ACID HAS BEEN INTEGRATED INTO THE \"DATABASES\" in the context of CMaNGOS installation is usually referring to the world database, which contains all of the content of the game world run by CMaNGOS. CMaNGOS databases cMaNGOS provides 3 different content databases depending on the core version: WOTLK-DB (for WotLK - 3.3.5a) TBC-DB (for TBC - 2.4.3) Classic-DB (for Classic - 1.12.1) Alternative databases A few other teams also provide databases that work with the cmangos core, and while we here at cmangos don\u2019t directly support them they still are a valid choice, and to some a more prefered one. YTDB (for WotLK - 3.3.5a) PSDB (for WotLK - 3.3.5a) World Of Warcraft Client is a client to connect to the server. It\u2019s your own copy of the game. Tools Git is a free distributed revision control or source code management tool which allows you to easily manage a virtual filesystem. With this tool, you\u2019ll download the code from CMaNGOS, ScriptDev2, and ACID. CMAKE its the most used tools that help to keep this project cross-platform. Microsoft Visual Studio is used to created, modify and compile the code using C and C++ programming languages. With this tool, you\u2019ll compile CMaNGOS and ScriptDev2 on Windows. MySQL server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that runs as a server providing multi-user access to a number of databases. After you\u2019ve created the databases and imported the data, they will contain your entire world for World of Warcraft. MySQL client allows you to connect to the MySQL server by providing an easy-to-use interface to import and change the data in the database. IRC is a simple chat system that is used by supporters and developers of CMaNGOS. How things fit together The following parts exist: Server services: The binary files mangosd(.exe) and realmd(.exe) manage the communication with the client World database: This database is filled by the database provider and contains content like NPCs, quests and objects Characters database: Contains the information about characters like player-name, level and items Realmd database: This database contains account-information (account-name, password and such) Client: Which will, with adapted realmlist , connect to your server Get the remote data to your system It is a good idea to start off your installation with some basic directory structure. See the below options depending on your operating system and follow along. For Windows CMaNGOS Installation Guide for Windows For this guide we will assume that you will use C:\\mangos as base directory under which you put everything. All shell commands are expected to be typed from a Git bash started from the C:\\mangos directory. To do so, right-click onto C:\\mangos in the windows explorer, and select Git bash here from the context menu. For *nix If desired, a new user can be created to run your mangos server under useradd -m -d /home/mangos -c \"MaNGOS\" -U mangos This guide assumes you will use this new user personal folder ( /home/mangos ) as a base folder under which you will put everything. cd /home/mangos Clone CMaNGOS After having opened Git bash in the right folder, simply type: Version Command Classic git clone git://github.com/cmangos/mangos-classic.git TBC git clone git://github.com/cmangos/mangos-tbc.git WotLK git clone git://github.com/cmangos/mangos-wotlk.git Submit this git command with enter/return. This will take a little time to complete, but afterwards you will have created a sub-directory named mangos-classic , mangos-tbc , or mangos-wotlk , into which the CMaNGOS sources are cloned. Important note: Throughout the guide some pathes will contain the string mangos-version . You will be expected to substitute -version , with the correct -classic , -tbc , or -wotlk , depending on which version you are installing. A simple video of the process Get the world-database stuff Official Databases Version Command Classic git clone git://github.com/cmangos/classic-db.git TBC git clone git://github.com/cmangos/tbc-db.git WotLK git clone git://github.com/cmangos/wotlk-db.git YTDB (WotLK) On Windows Open C:\\mangos in the explorer, right-click on the right hand side Select \"Tortoise SVN Checkout\" from the context menu. Insert as SVN-URL: http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/ytdbase/ On *nix svn co http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/ytdbase/ This will create a new folder (likely ytdbase ) in which YTDB SQL-files are located. On *nix svn co http://svn2.assembla.com/svn/ytdbase/Mangos/Cataclysm ytdbase/ This will create a new folder (likely ytdbase ) in which YTDB SQL-files are located. PSDB (WotLK) On Windows Open C:\\mangos in the explorer, right-click on the right hand side Select \"Tortoise SVN Checkout\" from the context menu. Insert as SVN-URL: http://svn.assembla.com/svn/psmdb_wotlk/ On *nix svn co http://svn.assembla.com/svn/psmdb_wotlk/ Directory structure Now you should have the following subfolders: mangos (containing the sources of CMaNGOS) classic-db OR tbc-db OR wotlk-db OR Database containing the content of your database-provider For windows we suggest creating an additional run folder, on *nix this can be useful if you don\u2019t want to install to /opt or so run For *nix or cmake compile we suggest creating an additional build folder, this is not required for Visual Studio build Compiling CMaNGOS Installing and Configuring boost (UNIX) The CMaNGOS cmake scripts should automatically detect the location of your boost installation, and configure the build accordingly. If it is not detected, please ensure that your BOOST_ROOT environment variable is set properly. On most *nix you just have to install boost development libraries from your distribution package repositories. On Debian and Ubuntu you can simply install the libboost-all-dev meta-package. On Fedora there should be a package named boost-devel (untested). If you followed the Software requirements (*nix) step above you should have the respective package installed already. For instructions on how to compile boost from source code or general information, see the boost Getting Started guide. Installing and Configuring boost (Windows) Video Guide - Download prebuild boost binaries - Set BOOST_ROOT environment variable Step-by-step Guide - Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries - Download the correct version as indicated in the table below or the boost_x_xx_x-bin-msvc-all-32-64.7z (the x_xx_x part is the boost version). If you need the Win32 or x64 version depends on what architecture you would like your compiled server executable to use. For most people x64 is fine. - Note: This has nothing to do with your Windows version , apart from the fact that 64bit executables will not run on a 32bit Windows. It is very unlikely you have a 32bit OS but if you want to make sure that you have a 64bit one press Win+Pause . - Note: You can install both the Win32 and the x64 binaries into the same directory, in case you want to switch build architectures. Visual Studio will automatically select the correct version. - Version 1.64.0 is working as of 2017-12-30. - You can try a more recent version if you want. - There have been problems reported with version 1.66.0. Win32 x64 VS 2015 boost_x_xx_x-msvc-14.0-32.exe boost_x_xx_x-msvc-14.0-64.exe VS 2017 boost_x_xx_x-msvc-14.1-32.exe boost_x_xx_x-msvc-14.1-64.exe Install the downloaded binaries. Go to the PC Properties (press <Win>+<Pause> ) Click on Advanced System Settings Click on Environment Variables At the bottom under System variables click New Name: BOOST_ROOT Value: C:\\local\\boost_x_xx_x Replace the x with the version number you downloaded, e.g. boost_1_64_0. If you changed the path while installing the binaries, you will have to do that here as well. Confirm To make sure all programs are aware of the added environment variable reboot your system. Additional remarks regarding boost for advanced users (Windows) If you are not using cmake, the built-in project files assume that BOOST_ROOT environment variable is set. If you have already boost in another folder schema you can also define BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to point to the right folder. Then only win32 or x64 will work according to the file you have on that folder. Point BOOST_LIBRARYDIR to the folder where the dll and lib files are, usually a subfolder of your boost root folder, e. g. the subfolder lib32-msvc-14.1. If you are using cmake to generate a solution and project files, the CMaNGOS cmake scripts should automatically detect the location of your boost installation, and configure the build accordingly. If it is not detected, please ensure that your BOOST_ROOT environment variable is set properly. For instructions on how to compile boost from source code or general information, see the boost Getting Started guide. Note: In a typical boost installation environment with Visual Studio, the user will configure their Visual Studio property sheets to point to the boost installation. This will allow boost to be found by all projects on that system. For information on configuring property sheets, look here . If you\u2019re experiencing issues with CMake (The following Boost libraries could not be found), you will have to rename folder in boost directory. (boost\\lib32-msvc-14.1 -> boost\\lib) Compiling CMaNGOS (Windows) A video of the build process is now available. Launch cmake Set the source bin to C:\\mangos\\mangos-version Set the destination folder to C:\\mangos\\mangos-version\\bin\\buildir (create that folder if it doesn\u2019t exist) Tick BUILD_EXTRACTORS Click Configure button and set your compiler version and platform. Select your options then click another time on Configure button Click 'Generate\u2019button Now you can click on Open button or go to C:\\mangos\\mangos-version\\bin\\buildir and click on the .sln file Wait for Visual Studio to finish loading. Open the menu \"Build\" \u2192 \"Configuration Manager\" Choose \"Release\" in the drop down box for \"Active Solution Configuration\" The drop down box \"Active Solution Platform\" should be set to \"Win32\" by default. Change it to \"x64\" if you want to compile 64bit executables. (This setting has to correspond with the boost version you installed.) Close the window Click the menu \"Build\" \u2192 \"Build Solution\" This will take some time. You might get some warning messages. Don\u2019t worry about it, that\u2019s normal. You must not get any error messages, although if you do so, you could click the menu \"Build\" \u2192 \"Clean Solution\" to restart the compile. If you get error messages saying some boost files cannot be found, you may need to restart your Visual Studio and/or your computer for the environment variables to be set. If you cannot solve an error, please use the official forums or IRC channels to ask for help Compiling CMaNGOS (*nix) Go to your /home/mangos folder: cd /home/mangos Enter the build folder: cd build Invoke cmake ../mangos , suggested options are: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\\../mangos/run to install into the \"run\" subfolder of /home/mangos folder, otherwise this will install to /opt/mangos -DPCH=1 to compile with PCH mode (much faster after updates). -DDEBUG=0 to remove debug mode from compiling -DBUILD_PLAYERBOT=ON to build with playerbots enabled Examples: Just want to compile CMaNGOS cmake ../mangos -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\\../mangos/run -DPCH=1 -DDEBUG=0 Want compile CMaNGOS & the map extraction tools cmake ../mangos -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\\../mangos/run -DBUILD_EXTRACTORS=ON -DPCH=1 -DDEBUG=0 Want compile CMaNGOS & the map extraction tools & playerbots cmake ../mangos -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\\../mangos/run -DBUILD_EXTRACTORS=ON -DPCH=1 -DDEBUG=0 -DBUILD_PLAYERBOT=ON Invoke make to compile CMaNGOS. You may specify the number of cores to be used with the -j option. make -j8 Invoke make install to install CMaNGOS to the location specified in DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX . Install CMaNGOS binary files Transfer the files from your compile folder (likely C:\\mangos\\mangos-version\\bin\\Win32_Release ) into C:\\mangos\\run Go to C:\\mangos\\mangos-version\\src\\game\\AuctionHouseBot and copy ahbot.conf.dist.in to C:\\mangos\\run and rename it to ahbot.conf If you compiled project with the PlayeBots enabled, go to C:\\mangos\\mangos-version\\src\\game\\PlayerBot and copy playerbot.conf.dist.in to C:\\mangos\\run and rename it to playerbot.conf On *nix this is partly done with the make install command (from the build directory). You will however still need to manually copy and rename the .conf.dist files to .conf files. Extract files from the client Windows Copy the content of C:\\mangos\\mangos-version\\bin\\Win32_Release\\Extractors\\ into your C:\\World of Warcraft folder Run ExtractResources.sh from your C:\\World of Warcraft . For this you can open a \"Git Bash\" on your C:\\World of Warcraft folder and type ExtractResources.sh Depending on your installation settings, a simple double click onto the ExtractResources.sh file from your explorer might also work. You must extract DBC/maps and vmaps for CMaNGOS to work, mmaps are optional (and take very long) When finished, move the folders maps , dbc , Cameras and vmaps - optionally mmaps - that have been created in your C:\\World of Warcraft to your C:\\mangos\\run (the buildings folder is not required and can be deleted). *nix Ever since extractors are no longer in repository, you will need to compile them yourself. The extraction process should work identically to Windows, since the scripts are portable. If you followed this guide the file can be found in: Executables: /home/mangos/mangos-version/run/bin/tools Scripts: /home/mangos/mangos-version/contrib/extractor_scripts Install databases For this section it is assumed you have already installed your MySQL server, and have a password for \"root\" user. To make use of some additional installation helper scripts it is HIGHLY suggested when installing MYSQL you include the command path to the BIN folder (Option during Install). If this option was not available or if you missed it please follow the instructions found here before proceeding. If you don\u2019t have this configured properly then you will not be able to follow along with the command-line steps below in the guide because the command prompt will not recognize \"mysql\" as a valid command. Create empty databases Either use a GUI tool for mysql and open the SQL-files, or do it by command-line as this guide shows. From the C:\\mangos folder invoke (in Git bash): mysql -uroot -p < mangos/sql/create/db_create_mysql.sql Enter your password in the following dialogue (similar in all other next steps) This will create a user (name mangos , password mangos ) with rights to the databases mangos (world-db), characters and realmd Initialize Mangos database From the C:\\mangos folder invoke (in Git bash): Version Command Classic mysql -uroot -p classicmangos < mangos-classic/sql/base/mangos.sql TBC mysql -uroot -p tbcmangos < mangos-tbc/sql/base/mangos.sql WotLK mysql -uroot -p wotlkmangos < mangos-wotlk/sql/base/mangos.sql This will create and fill the Mangos database with some values. Initialize DBC data From the C:\\mangos folder invoke (in Git bash): Version Command Classic mysql -uroot -p classicmangos < mangos-classic/sql/base/dbc/*.sql TBC mysql -uroot -p tbcmangos < mangos-tbc/sql/base/dbc/*.sql WotLK mysql -uroot -p wotlkmangos < mangos-wotlk/sql/base/dbc/*.sql This will create and fill in Mangos database the imported DBC data. On *nix you may want to use the following two scripted commands: Version Command Classic for sql_file in ls mangos-classic/sql/base/dbc/original_data/*.sql; do mysql -uroot -p --database=classicmangos < $sql_file ; done TBC for sql_file in ls mangos-tbc/sql/base/dbc/original_data/*.sql; do mysql -uroot -p --database=tbcmangos < $sql_file ; done WotLK for sql_file in ls mangos-wotlk/sql/base/dbc/original_data/*.sql; do mysql -uroot -p --database=wotlkmangos < $sql_file ; done Version Command Classic for sql_file in ls mangos-classic/sql/base/dbc/cmangos_fixes/*.sql; do mysql -uroot -p --database=classicmangos < $sql_file ; done TBC for sql_file in ls mangos-tbc/sql/base/dbc/cmangos_fixes/*.sql; do mysql -uroot -p --database=tbcmangos < $sql_file ; done WotLK for sql_file in ls mangos-wotlk/sql/base/dbc/cmangos_fixes/*.sql; do mysql -uroot -p --database=wotlkmangos < $sql_file ; done Initialize characters database: From the C:\\mangos folder invoke (in Git bash): Version Command Classic mysql -uroot -p classiccharacters < mangos-classic/sql/base/characters.sql TBC mysql -uroot -p tbccharacters < mangos-tbc/sql/base/characters.sql WotLK mysql -uroot -p wotlkcharacters < mangos-wotlk/sql/base/characters.sql This will create an empty characters database. Initialize realmd database: From the C:\\mangos folder invoke (in Git bash): Version Command Classic mysql -uroot -p classicrealmd < mangos-classic/sql/base/realmd.sql TBC mysql -uroot -p tbcrealmd < mangos-tbc/sql/base/realmd.sql WotLK mysql -uroot -p wotlkrealmd < mangos-wotlk/sql/base/realmd.sql This will create an empty realmd database. Fill world database: Support for cmangos databases. From the C:\\mangos folder invoke (in Git bash or depending on installation with double-click!) Run cd classic-db , cd tbc-db , or cd wotlk-db (choose the one applicable to your situation) Run ./InstallFullDB.sh This will create a config file named InstallFullDB.config , looking like this: #################################################################################################### # This is the config file for the './InstallFullDB.sh' script # # You need to insert # MANGOS_DBHOST: Your MANGOS database host # MANGOS_DBNAME: Your MANGOS database schema # MANGOS_DBUSER: Your MANGOS username # MANGOS_DBPASS: Your MANGOS password # CORE_PATH: Your path to core's directory # MYSQL: Your mysql command (usually mysql) # #################################################################################################### ## Define the host on which the mangos database resides (typically localhost) MANGOS_DBHOST=\"localhost\" ## Define the database in which you want to add clean DB MANGOS_DBNAME=\"VERSIONmangos\" ## Define your username MANGOS_DBUSER=\"mangos\" ## Define your password (It is suggested to restrict read access to this file!) MANGOS_DBPASS=\"mangos\" ## Define the path to your core's folder ## If set the core updates located under sql/updates/mangos from this mangos-directory will be added automatically CORE_PATH=\"\" ## Define your mysql programm if this differs MYSQL=\"mysql\" # Enjoy using the tool Change configuration in any text-editor With the default configuration, you only need to change CORE_PATH to: CORE_PATH=\"../mangos-version\" This assumes database and core repositories have been cloned to the same location, e.g. they are both in C:\\mangos or /home/mangos . If relative path does not work, use absolute path: Windows: CORE_PATH=\"/c/mangos/mangos-version\" (case-sensitive) *nix: CORE_PATH=\"/home/mangos/mangos-version\" Now the helper tool is configured, and you only need to run the helper script again, whenever you want to set your world database to a clear state! sh ./InstallFullDB.sh And check the output if the database could be set up correctly. If the helper script complains about not finding the config file, just open InstallFullDB.sh in a text editor and set SCRIPT_FILE=\"./InstallFullDB.sh\" CONFIG_FILE=\"./InstallFullDB.config\" You can now run the script again, and it should start filling your world database. cd ../.. If you get an error saying ./InstallFullDB.sh: line 126: mysql: command not found then you need to add mysql.exe to the PATH variable. (Windows + Pause \u2192 Advanced System Settings \u2192 Environment Variables \u2192 System Variables \u2192 Edit Path and add the location of your mysql.exe) Basic concept of manual database filling The database providers provide A full-dump release file: This file contains the whole database content of one point Updatepacks: An updatepack consist of - collected core updates for the mangos (world) database - collected core updates for the characters database - collected core updates for the realmd database - content fixes So you need to: - Apply the latest release file - Apply all following updatepack files (always corepatches before updatepacks) - Apply the remaining updates from the core (located in C:\\mangos\\mangos-version\\sql\\updates Alternative Databases Execute PSDB_Installer in psmdb_wotlk svn folder.

Configuring CMaNGOS This part should be an extra wiki-page: Meaning of config files from mangos/sd2 With the default installations, you should get a working environment out of the box :) (OPTIONAL) Update *.conf files You will need to manually update the configuration files within your \"run\" directory (ie C:\\mangos\\run ). The files are: mangosd.conf: Holds configuration for the mangosd executable realmd.conf: Holds configuration for the realmd executable scriptdev2.conf: Holds configuration for ScriptDev2\u2019s settings(no longer used and may not exist) (Very optional) ahbot.conf: Holds configuration for AHBot (by default disabled) (optional, only if you enabled PlayerBots during complilation) playerbot.conf: Holds configuration for PlayerBots (by default disabled) Most important to configure are the database settings.

These settings are relatively self-explaining, you should look for the settings of \"LoginDatabaseInfo\", \"WorldDatabaseInfo\", \"CharacterDatabaseInfo\" and \"ScriptDev2DatabaseInfo\" (no file contains all of these options) (OPTIONAL) Update realmd.realmlist You need to change this only if you changed the mangosd.conf settings \"WorldServerPort\" or \"RealmID\" This information is required so that the realmd \"knows\" to which mangosd he should forward a player after authentication, so if you want to use your server outside itself (e.g. on your LAN) please change 127.0.0.1 by your server ip ! Apply code to realmd database, adapt to your wishes DELETE FROM realmlist WHERE id=1; INSERT INTO realmlist (id, name, address, port, icon, realmflags, timezone, allowedSecurityLevel) VALUES ('1', 'MaNGOS', '127.0.0.1', '8085', '1', '0', '1', '0'); Where of course the data must match the configs: port (above 8085) must match the value in the mangosd.conf (Config option: \"WorldServerPort\") id (above 1) must match the value in the mangosd.conf (Config option: \"RealmID\") Configuring your WoW-Client Copy C:\\World Of Warcraft\\Data\\enEN\\realmlist.wtf to realmlist.old within the same folder Your locale folder may be named differently according to your region (\"enUS\", \"enGB\", \"frFR\", \"deDE\", etc) Open realmlist.wtf in Notepad and change the contents to the following: set realmlist 127.0.0.1 Always use the wow.exe and NOT the launcher to start your WoW-Client Running your Server On Windows system launch C:\\mangos\\run\\mangosd.exe and C:\\mangos\\run\\realmd.exe On *nix run the corresponding binary files : /home/mangos/mangos-version/run/bin/mangosd -c /home/mangos/mangos-version/run/etc/mangosd.conf -a /home/mangos/mangos-version/run/etc/ahbot.conf /home/mangos/mangos-version/run/bin/realmd -c /home/mangos/mangos-version/run/etc/realmd.conf Tip1 Don\u2019t run mangosd or realmd as root ! su mangos This command will connect you as mangos user.

Creating first account: Once everything in mangosd has loaded, here are some commands you can use. In your Mangosd window, there is tons of text; not to worry, keep typing anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter Creating the actual account account create [username] [password] Example: account create MyNewAccount MyPassword Enabling expansions for a user account set addon [username] [0 to 3] 0: Basic version 1: The Burning Crusade 2: Wrath of the Lich King Example: account set addon MyNewAccount 2 Changing GM levels account set gmlevel [username] [0 to 3] 0: Player 1: Moderator 2: Game Master 3: Administrator Example: account set gmlevel MyNewAccount 2 Shutdown your server .server shutdown [delay] The delay is the number of seconds First login: Always use the wow.exe and NOT the launcher to start your WoW-Client Start your WoW-Client with the wow.exe and login with your previously created account name (NOT email) and password. Note that if this account is GM-Account, you can use lots of nice commands to get around, (remark the . with which they all start) ie: .tele <location> .lookup .npc info and .npc aiinfo .modify aspeed <rate> .gm fly on (note that although the command is available, it does not work on the classic core) Enjoy running and messing with your CMaNGOS server!","title":"Installation Guide"},{"location":"Installation-Instructions/#introduction","text":"How to install C(ontinued)-MaNGOS from scratch and how to update it.

Hopefully you also understand what the realmd and mangosd applications are as well. How do all of these things communicate with each other and make it so you can play WoW on your own server? Read on and find out! Why So Many Pieces? An MMO is a massively complicated piece of work and so it takes many different pieces to make it run. It's not as simple as playing a game on your local computer like The Sims or Skyrim. Why? Well in those types of games all of the information is stored on your computer and there is no need to be online to play them. They have their own databases built into the game and there is only one player so you only have to load each room or area where the player is. In an MMO, however, the entire game world is always running and there are multiple players communicating and interacting with it. Furthermore, variables throughout the world cannot be saved locally because: (1) the more information that is on the client, the more potential for hacking and exploiting there is because players have access to the client; and (2) different players interact with the same world which responds to their actions. Therefore information needs to be saved in a neutral location, otherwise information stored on one player's client would suddenly become unavailable to other players when that player disconnected from the game. All of this necessitates the concept of having a single \"server\" that hosts the world and multiple \"clients\" that connect to it. The Game Server The mangosd.exe application is the server which runs the realm and all the events that happen inside of it. The game server not only hosts the physical environment but also manages all non-player actions and events such as NPCs and creatures, the weather system, game events like the various seasonal festivals, and pretty much anything else you can think of that isn't your character moving around. The Client The wow.exe application is the client which players use to launch the game and connect to and communicate with the game server. The Login Server You can't just connect to a server without having created an account first and so we need a login server to manage accounts and passwords. This is the realmd.exe application which also directs connecting clients to the realm that they want to play on after authenticating the player's login credentials. The Database Even if we have a mangosd.exe and a realmd.exe running, there still needs to be a place to store the accounts and passwords and the objects and things in the game as well as the many variables associated with a single player; and so we have a third server called the database to store all of this information. How They Work Together So you have your servers running and you are ready to try it out. You launch wow.exe... The first thing that happens is the client attempts to find a login server at the location you told it to look: the address you entered into the realmlist.wtf document. Say you want the client to look for a login server on the same computer that you are running wow.exe: you would direct it to 127.0.0.1 (a universal address for your local computer to connect to itself). Because you have realmd.exe running, the client finds it and you are now ready to login. You type in some credentials and the server tells you that they are wrong, why? Because the login server needs to have your account stored somewhere in order to accept your credentials. So now you switch over to your mangosd.exe application to create a new account. You type in the command \"account create user password\" which then adds a new account to the \"realmd\" MySQL database with the name \"user\" and the password \"password.\" You can now go back to your wow.exe client and type in the new credentials; the login server accepts your connection and allows you to select a realm to enter and begin playing. There will only be one available realm which by default is called \"Mangos.\" You click on the realm and it loads the characters screen. Because this account was just created there are no saved characters so you create a new human warrior called \"test\" and enter the world. As soon as you create test the human warrior, it is assigned an id number and all of the starting statistics, skills, abilities, and items are added to the \"characters\" MySQL database. Any time anything with the character changes, mangosd.exe will send an update to the MySQL database with the new information and save it there (character saves also occur at regular intervals in case the server crashes). So you talked to the guard and moved around a bit and you are ready to start slaying some wolves. You target a wolf and right click to begin attacking. Because you are standing too far away the game tells you that you must move closer. You run up to the wolf and as soon as you are within range, you swing and take the wolf down to 50% health and it begins attacking you back. You may not realize it but a dozen processes and checks were just executed for that simple encounter. You right clicked on the creature : the game server checked to see if you were in range by comparing your coordinates stored locally on the client to the coordinates of the creature stored in the \"mangos\" database. When it determined that you were not within range for a melee attack, it returned an error and a message that you are out of range (and probably played a bit of audio of your character saying something like \"I'm out of range\"). You ran up to the wolf until you were in range : your melee attack attempts to connect every few seconds (based on your weapon's attack speed) and so every time it tries to attack it checks your coordinates vs. your target's to see if you are in range. Because you were moving toward your target, the game repeated this check probably several times before it finally \"passed\" because you were in range. You hit the wolf and take it's health down by 50% : so the game confirmed that you were in range and that you hit your target. It checked your weapon's attack damage against the wolf's defenses and randomly calculated an amount of damage based on those variables. It then subtracted that amount from the wolf's health. The wolf begins attacking you : the wolf creature template is associated with a certain script which determines its behavior. Because this script tells it to defend itself, the game server directed the wolf to attack the hostile player hitting it. Now let's say you want to create a guild. You travel to Stormwind and talk to the guildmaster dude to get a charter. You then get some friends to sign the charter (after of course managing to get your server setup so that other players can connect to it) and go back to the guildmaster. You submit your charter and voila... your guild is created. In that transaction mangosd.exe accepted input from the wow.exe client and then sent a command to the \"characters\" MySQL database to store: the name of the guild, the guild master, the tabard design and emblem, the various characters who are now members and their ranks, and a number of other variables. As you can see, every little action and exchange of information is incredibly complicated and requires a lot of quick and efficient communication between the client and the multiple pieces of the server. Diagram of Client-Server Interactions What's Next? Now you can move on to the installation instructions and get started! Remember that the forums and the #cmangos IRC channel are full of people available to help you with any issues so don't be afraid to ask. Once you have a server up and running we encourage you to participate in the community, report bugs, and if you have some programming skills, try your hand at fixing or enhancing the repositories.

Beginner's Guide Home","title":"What's Next?"},{"location":"Beginners-Guide/Beginners-Guide-Introduction/","text":"First of all you should know that it isn't that difficult to get your own server up and running with all of the tools provided by the CMaNGOS team. Once you have the necessary programs installed it takes about 10 minutes to compile the source code and start up a server. You don't need to be a programmer and you don't really need to be that tech savvy. As long as you can follow instructions and aren't afraid to ask questions on the forums, you will get there with no (major) problems. Mangos... like the fruit? Why is it called CMaNGOS? It is just a fun acronym that is easy to remember and say... like the fruit. Here is what it stands for: C (ontinued) Ma (ssive) N (etwork) G (ame) O (bject) S (erver). The originating project was just called MaNGOS and so this is a \"continued\" version of the original. What is git? Git is a source code revision control system and that's all you need to know about it for now (even though that may make no sense to you anyway). Github is the important thing to understand at the moment; it is a sort of social networking site for programmers and collaborators to share ideas and keep track of projects and it uses \"git\" to operate. Every time something is changed in the source code of a project it is tracked and recorded on Github. It also enables multiple people to work on their own versions of a project and then submit updates to the main version once they are perfected. Think of it like the project being a binder with a bunch of pages. If you wanted to, for example, add a new section to the binder, Github makes it so you can copy the whole thing and take it home with you to work on in your spare time. Then once you've finished adding the pages to your copy, you bring it back to the main project and suggest that the original project be updated with your changes. As you can imagine, this makes the whole process a lot easier to manage because you can have any number of people working on their own ideas without breaking the initial project. Github also has features to track issues with the code so that programmers can pickup various reported bugs, fix them, apply the fix to the main project, and then show that the fix was implemented. What are all these words? There are a lot of terms ahead that you may not be familiar with so let's get started with some vocabulary: Source Code > Source Code is the basic foundation of programming; it is the actual code that is typed out by programmers in any of the thousands of different programming languages. C++ or CPP > Written both ways interchangeably, C++ (pronounced \"see-plus-plus\") is a programming language. Everything in CMaNGOS (except for the databases) is written in C++. Server > In a client-server relationship, the \"server\" is where information is stored. The server hosts an environment or database of information for clients to connect to and retrieve. In the context of CMaNGOS, \"Server\" could refer to many things such as the game server, the login server, or the database server. Client > In a client-server relationship, the \"client\" is where information is viewed. The client connects to the server and retrieves packets of information to display to the user. In the context of CMaNGOS, \"Client\" will always refer to the WoW game client that you have installed on your computer. Repository > If Github was a filing cabinet then a repository would be a single folder in said cabinet. Projects are referred to as \"repos\" in this world because you are basically referring to a folder with a bunch of source code in it. Open Source > Open source refers to the concept of everything being open and available to share with anyone. In the programming world, open source means that the code is openly shared and available to anyone to add to, edit, or copy as they wish (within the bounds of the respective terms of use). Compile > When code is written it just looks like a bunch of text and symbols organized in strange ways that makes no sense to non-programmers. \"Compiling\" is the process of turning said code into a working program. Compiler > Code doesn't compile itself and so we must use other programs to do it. These programs are called compilers. Bug > A bug is a term programmers use to describe problems with code. A bug is usually the culprit when a program you are using shuts down for no apparent reason or when something just doesn't work. Database > A database is a big heap of information typically organized in columns and rows much like an excel spreadsheet. SQL > SQL is another programming language which stands for Structured Query Language and is used for managing databases. SQL Server > An SQL Server is a virtual database (see above) that stores a bunch of stuff and uses the SQL language to operate. SQL Client > Just because an SQL Server exists doesn't mean you can look at it like you would an excel sheet, at least not without another program. An SQL Client is a program that visualizes an SQL Server so that you can actually click and open things on the screen. MySQL > MySQL is a version of SQL that CMaNGOS uses. Continuing with the spreadsheet example, it would be like deciding to use Microsoft Excel vs Google Spreadsheet. Both basically do the same thing but have different interfaces, styles, and associated programs. Query > A query is a command being executed in SQL. When you update something on the server it sends a query just as when you pull information from the server it uses a query. Within the instructions, using a query will typically refer to entering a specific command into the command prompt or terminal you are using. Step-by-step So from start to finish, this is a quick summary of the steps you will take to get a server running. You may not understand many (or any) of these yet but you have to start somewhere! Download and install all the tools mentioned in the installation instructions (e.g. Git, Visual Studio, etc). Download or install a WoW client and patch it to the proper version of the server you want to build (e.g. if you were building a Classic server you would need a WoW client patched to version 1.12.1). Setup a MySQL Server. Create a folder on your hard drive to place all of your work. Copy the necessary repositories from Github to said folder. Compile the source code. Create and populate your MySQL Server databases. Extract resources from your WoW client. Move all necessary files and resources to your \"run\" folder. Edit the configuration files. Run realmd.exe. Run mangosd.exe. If updates are needed to your databases, apply them as needed and restart mangosd.exe. Update your client's realmlist.wtf document to point to your server. Run wow.exe and enjoy! Where do I start? The next sections of this guide will focus on all of the different pieces of CMaNGOS and how they work together. Remember that this guide will not tell you how to put them together, it will just give you a simplified explanation of what everything is. The Installation Instructions (found here ) is where you should go for the actual process of building a CMaNGOS server.

It also enables multiple people to work on their own versions of a project and then submit updates to the main version once they are perfected. Think of it like the project being a binder with a bunch of pages. If you wanted to, for example, add a new section to the binder, Github makes it so you can copy the whole thing and take it home with you to work on in your spare time. Then once you've finished adding the pages to your copy, you bring it back to the main project and suggest that the original project be updated with your changes. As you can imagine, this makes the whole process a lot easier to manage because you can have any number of people working on their own ideas without breaking the initial project. Github also has features to track issues with the code so that programmers can pickup various reported bugs, fix them, apply the fix to the main project, and then show that the fix was implemented.","title":"What is git?"},{"location":"Beginners-Guide/Beginners-Guide-Introduction/#what-are-all-these-words","text":"There are a lot of terms ahead that you may not be familiar with so let's get started with some vocabulary: Source Code > Source Code is the basic foundation of programming; it is the actual code that is typed out by programmers in any of the thousands of different programming languages. C++ or CPP > Written both ways interchangeably, C++ (pronounced \"see-plus-plus\") is a programming language. Everything in CMaNGOS (except for the databases) is written in C++. Server > In a client-server relationship, the \"server\" is where information is stored. The server hosts an environment or database of information for clients to connect to and retrieve. In the context of CMaNGOS, \"Server\" could refer to many things such as the game server, the login server, or the database server. Client > In a client-server relationship, the \"client\" is where information is viewed. The client connects to the server and retrieves packets of information to display to the user. In the context of CMaNGOS, \"Client\" will always refer to the WoW game client that you have installed on your computer. Repository > If Github was a filing cabinet then a repository would be a single folder in said cabinet. Projects are referred to as \"repos\" in this world because you are basically referring to a folder with a bunch of source code in it. Open Source > Open source refers to the concept of everything being open and available to share with anyone. In the programming world, open source means that the code is openly shared and available to anyone to add to, edit, or copy as they wish (within the bounds of the respective terms of use). Compile > When code is written it just looks like a bunch of text and symbols organized in strange ways that makes no sense to non-programmers. \"Compiling\" is the process of turning said code into a working program. Compiler > Code doesn't compile itself and so we must use other programs to do it. These programs are called compilers. Bug > A bug is a term programmers use to describe problems with code. A bug is usually the culprit when a program you are using shuts down for no apparent reason or when something just doesn't work. Database > A database is a big heap of information typically organized in columns and rows much like an excel spreadsheet. SQL > SQL is another programming language which stands for Structured Query Language and is used for managing databases. SQL Server > An SQL Server is a virtual database (see above) that stores a bunch of stuff and uses the SQL language to operate. SQL Client > Just because an SQL Server exists doesn't mean you can look at it like you would an excel sheet, at least not without another program. An SQL Client is a program that visualizes an SQL Server so that you can actually click and open things on the screen. MySQL > MySQL is a version of SQL that CMaNGOS uses. Continuing with the spreadsheet example, it would be like deciding to use Microsoft Excel vs Google Spreadsheet. Both basically do the same thing but have different interfaces, styles, and associated programs. Query > A query is a command being executed in SQL. When you update something on the server it sends a query just as when you pull information from the server it uses a query. Within the instructions, using a query will typically refer to entering a specific command into the command prompt or terminal you are using.","title":"What are all these words?"},{"location":"Beginners-Guide/Beginners-Guide-Introduction/#step-by-step","text":"So from start to finish, this is a quick summary of the steps you will take to get a server running. You may not understand many (or any) of these yet but you have to start somewhere! Download and install all the tools mentioned in the installation instructions (e.g. Git, Visual Studio, etc). Download or install a WoW client and patch it to the proper version of the server you want to build (e.g. if you were building a Classic server you would need a WoW client patched to version 1.12.1). Setup a MySQL Server. Create a folder on your hard drive to place all of your work. Copy the necessary repositories from Github to said folder. Compile the source code. Create and populate your MySQL Server databases. Extract resources from your WoW client. Move all necessary files and resources to your \"run\" folder. Edit the configuration files. Run realmd.exe. Run mangosd.exe. If updates are needed to your databases, apply them as needed and restart mangosd.exe. Update your client's realmlist.wtf document to point to your server. Run wow.exe and enjoy!","title":"Step-by-step"},{"location":"Beginners-Guide/Beginners-Guide-Introduction/#where-do-i-start","text":"The next sections of this guide will focus on all of the different pieces of CMaNGOS and how they work together. Remember that this guide will not tell you how to put them together, it will just give you a simplified explanation of what everything is. The Installation Instructions (found here ) is where you should go for the actual process of building a CMaNGOS server. Next: What Everything Is Beginner's Guide Home","title":"Where do I start?"},{"location":"Beginners-Guide/Beginners-Guide-What-Everything-Is/","text":"What follows is an explanation of all the pieces to CMaNGOS from a beginner's perspective so that you can better grasp why everything works. Even if you follow the instructions step-by-step, you may end up with a working server but have absolutely no idea how or why which makes it difficult to replicate, make changes, or fix things. Github As described earlier, Github is a networking tool and a location to store data. In most cases, the data is code for various applications. Users can follow certain projects and comment on things while also contributing by suggesting changes, giving feedback and collaborating with others. CMaNGOS Repositories The CMaNGOS project has a repository located at https://github.com/cmangos which itself contains sub-repositories for each version of WoW currently supported. Each repository contains an assortment of folders and files which make up the code structure of all \"server side\" applications needed to host a WoW server. When you follow the installation instructions you will be directed to retrieve the code from these repositories and store them on your local computer. You will then use a compiler to compile the code which produces a bunch of files and applications. Commits When things are changed on a repository it is referred to as a \"commit\" and assigned a unique tag to identify it. Commits can only be completed by users with the proper permissions to a repository to keep the process stable. This way any user can submit a suggested change but only the developers with the most experience can actually update the repository. Issues/Bugs Bugs are typically reported and tracked on Github via the \"Issues Tracker.\" CMaNGOS uses a centralized issue tracker for all repositories located here instead of having multiple trackers for each individual version. Until you really know what you are doing, it is recommended that you don't start off submitting what you think are bugs into the issues tracker. Most of the time (for newbies), it is something you missed with the installation or configuration steps. Once you get a handle on everything, then you can start submitting bugs when you come across them (and you definitely should, it is the only way the developers will know if something needs fixing!). cmangos.net Forums The forums at cmangos.net are where you go to ask questions and get help as well as make suggestions or provide feedback. Check it out and register an account! Everyone is very friendly and helpful and can answer just about any question or issue you have. That being said, please try to search for your issues in the installation instructions and forums before posting as there may already be an answer somewhere. MySQL Server and Databases At the beginning of the installation instructions you are advised to setup a MySQL Server and have it running before continuing. There is no guide for setting up a MySQL Server within the CMaNGOS project because MySQL does not exist solely for CMaNGOS, in fact it is used by a lot of different applications around the world. Subsequently you will find that there are numerous guides for setting up and configuring MySQL servers and other products from MySQL all over the internet. Do some google searches and you should find one that suits your needs. The MySQL Server houses a vast amount of information broken down into databases. These databases tell the CMaNGOS game what actually exists in each server including: account names and passwords, characters, inventories, objects, items, npcs, enemies, loot, bosses, quests, guilds, resource nodes, etc. Basically, if you have an \"empty\" database and you log in to your game server, nothing will exist. I would just be a big empty world. You could think of the game server as a castle but it only has the terrain, a moat, walls and nothing else. When you link the game server to a database, it then populates the castle with a gate, drawbridge, windows, guards, weapons, food, and any other objects that the player can interact with or see. Within each database you will find a number of \"tables\" which can be thought of like different excel spreadsheets which have the actual information. So in descending order, here is a breakdown of a MySQL Server: MySQL Server > Database > Table > Information It is highly recommended that you obtain an SQL Client (such as SQLyog) as it will really help you to visualize what is going on in the database and how it is structured. Where is this server? The MySQL Server application will run in the background of your computer (for windows users you can see it in the \"Services\" tab of Task Manager): You can start up and shutdown your MySQL Server at will but it will need to be running in order for your game server to access the database. You may find it beneficial to pick up an SQL server utility which monitors your SQL server and gives you a simple menu to start and stop it from. CMaNGOS Databases Once you have a MySQL Server running and finish the installation instructions for CMaNGOS you will find four new \"databases\" inside: realmd, characters, mangos, and scriptdev2. What follows is a quick summary of what each database contains. realmd database This database contains the game server and player account information. Within the database you will find a table called realmlist which contains the information for directing your WoW game client to your game server. There are also tables containing the accounts for logging into your game server as well as banned accounts and a few other tables for similar information. characters database This database contains multiple tables which store the information relative to each character in the game: what their skills are, what talents they've selected, the guild they belong to, what is in their inventory, etc. mangos database This database contains everything about the actual game world: items, resource nodes, npcs, enemies, quests; everything down to the last crate stacked up in a corner of Stormwind. This database is obviously the largest. scriptdev2 database This database is for special \"scripts\" which direct events that occur in the game. A script is exactly what it sounds like: a set of directions. Only these directions are for non-player creatures and objects to follow (think of it like the script to a play but the play is based on what the audience is doing). How do Stormwind guards know to patrol paths around the city and attack bad guys when they show up? A script tells them. Some scripts are built into the game itself while others are mapped out in the mangos database. ScriptDev2 is a more advanced system used for complicated scripts like boss fights and big events. Executable Applications Executable applications (often referred to as \"binaries\") are part of the files created when you finish compiling the code. These particular files end with .exe as you may have noticed many applications on a computer do. There are really only two important executable files generated from the CMaNGOS code: realmd.exe and mangosd.exe. When you \"start up\" a server you will really just run both of these applications and let them do all of the work. If there are issues with your configuration or databases, they will give you detailed error messages advising what needs to be looked at. Your server will continue to operate as long as these two applications are running. realmd The realmd.exe file is the first level of connectivity with your WoW client. When the game starts it will try to connect to a realmd type server. When you type in your login information realmd attempts to match it with the accounts it has stored in the database and then moves you on to select a realm. mangosd The mangosd.exe file is the actual game server itself (known more commonly as a realm). While it is running you will see all sorts of messages appearing while events are going on and you can even type commands into it for the server to execute. Configuration Files Part of the installation instructions will have you moving several text documents over to your \"run\" folder and renaming them so that they end with .conf. These are the configuration files that determine how your server will operate. All you have to do is edit the values according to the instructions provided inside each one to make things run how you want them to. realmd.conf This file is used to tell your realmd.exe application which database to use to store account information. You can also configure some basic features for locking accounts and banning IPs that attempt to login with bad credentials too often. mangosd.conf Perhaps the most important configuration file, mangosd.conf contains a multitude of variables which (most importantly) tell your mangosd.exe application which databases to use for characters, accounts, and the game world. You can also adjust a number of different settings for how the realm behaves such as xp rates, pvp, and much more (just look through the document and read the instructions to see what all you can change). scriptdev2.conf There is only one thing to configure on this file and that is to tell your mangosd.exe application which scriptdev2 database to use. ahbot.conf This is an optional configuration file which, if added to your \"run\" folder will enable you to use the AH bot (a bot system that simulates an active auction house that buys and sells things to make it feel like there are more players on the server). mods.conf Another optional file which will allow you to enable or disable special modifications for your server that are not part of the standard game. Game Resources One of the last steps in the installation instructions has you extract \"resources\" from your WoW client. This process produces four folders that then need to be moved into your \"run\" folder in order for the game server to function: dbc, maps, vmaps, and mmaps. DBCs DBCs are game files which provide details on things like spells. You might notice that the majority of \"simple\" spells and items are contained within the databases whereas more complex ones can only be stored in the DBCs. MAPS Pretty straight forward: the maps folder contains all of the physical maps that the server will be running (the actual world environment). VMAPS Vmaps are like overlays for maps that specify how \"line of site\" (LOS) is calculated for players and creatures. So basically they tell the game server where objects are that obstruct LOS like trees, buildings, and crates. MMAPS Mmaps are similar overlays that tell the server where to route creatures and NPCs so that they don't run over top of rocks and fence posts. They aren't technically necessary but they greatly enhance the game experience and there isn't really a good reason not to use them. Note that creating the mmaps can take several hours so you may want to start the process before going to bed or leaving for work. When you extract resources from the client using the ExtractResources.sh script it will tell you this and even give you an option to delay the mmaps. Okay that's great, now what? Now we move on to how all of these things work together.

Exceptions are allowed for independent libraries used in the project, but it is generally advisable all contributors to use this style. Tab size First of all, we use space. Tabs are four-character width. That is, no 8-space tabs, no 2-space tabs. Four. Unfortunately there's no such thing as 'standard tab width', and 4-space indenting looks best from our point of view, besides MSVC' editor has this setting by default. Line length Then, please use 80-character wide lines. If your line is way longer than that, please split it. If it's just a little longer, so be it. The continuation text, if you're splitting text inside the brackets, should be indented to the position after the opening bracket: printf(\"This is a example of how we split lines longer than %d characters\\n\" \"into several so that they won't exceed this limit.\\n\", max_sourcecode_width); If you have long strings, you can split them as shown above, just remember that C/C** compilers will glue together several strings that come without any special characters between them into one. Brackets Now we use symmetric bracket placement, closing bracked under the opening bracket: if (something) { ...; } else { ...; } switch (x) { case 1: printf(\"X is one!\\n\"); break; case 2: { printf(\"X is two!\\n\"); break; } } for (int i = 1; i < 3; ++i) { printf(\"I is %i!\\n\", i); } Every bracketed block moves its contents by one tab to right. Labels (but not case selectors or 'public:/private:/protected' C** keywords) are placed at the leftmost indention position for the current block, that is, in the same position where enclosing brackets are. Also please don't use brackets around a single statement because it clutters the code with unneeded stuff; use brackets only when using non-obvious constructs, like: if (...) { if (...) ...; } else ...; Also, please place one space before opening parenthesis. Before, but not after (the if ( blah ) style is a no-no!). Class declaration and constructors class Class : public Parent { public: Class() : Parent(0), m_field(1) { func(); } void func() {} private: int m_field; }; Main points: a) space before and after : in class parents list and constructor body b) next line and indent for class field initialization list c) indent for public:/private:/protected: section with additional indent for section content d) empty or short function body can be at same line with declaration in in-class definition case Code documentation with Doxygen Now, please use DoxyGen-type comments. This is a bit similar to JavaDoc comments and to other automatic code documentation generation tools.

Push the commits"},{"location":"DB-Structure/Characters/Character_data/","text":"The following is a table containing indices and what values they contain for character.data . The source of this data is UpdateFields.h The .getvalue and .setvalue commands deal with the indices in this table. To modify any of the values in this table in real time, use the .setvalue command with the correct index (eg. .setvalue 4 2 0 sets the target's size to 2.00 (notice that it is a float, hence the 0 at the end)). All objects in the game (game objects, creatures, and players) share the OBJECT * fields while only creatures and players share the UNIT * fields while only players use the PLAYER_* fields. If you want to use direct SQL to extract a single value from this rather large blob, the syntax to use is this: SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', <index + 1>), ' ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) AS `fieldName` FROM `characters`; Just replace <index + 1> with the index in this table and add one to it. The reason why you are adding one is because of how the nested SUBSTRING_INDEX syntax works. Let's analyze the function calls. Working from the inside out, the first function called is SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', <index + 1>) . The SUBSTRING_INDEX function creates a substring from the big data blob after <index + 1> spaces. Notice that if we used just , the substring would be everything up to the value we want but not including it . The second function call is SUBSTRING_INDEX(<substring from inner function>, ' ', -1) . This function call uses -1 as the count, meaning that it will substring from the end to the front. Since it is a count of one, it will create a substring that is exactly the value we want because the value we want is sandwiched between the end of the string and a space. The final function call CAST(<substring> AS UNSIGNED) casts the final string into an unsigned integer. This is because the data blob contains only numbers and if we cast the string into an integer, we can use integer operations on it (say if we use it in a WHERE clause to compare to another integer). An example of the syntax in use is the following query where we are making a list of characters and their levels who have more than 1000 gold. SELECT `guid`, `name`, CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', 35), ' ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) AS `level` FROM `characters` WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', 1398), ' ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) > 10000000; If you want to edit the value of one of these fields, the query to do that is the following but don't forget to backup your table first: UPDATE `characters` SET `data`=CONCAT(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', <index>) AS CHAR), ' ', <value>, ' ', CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', <-(max index - index) - 1>)AS CHAR)) [WHERE ...] Replace <index> with the index that you want to change (look at table below), <-(max_index - index) - 1> with the negative of the subtraction of the last index (look at table) minus the index that you want to change and finally minus one. Finally replace <value> with the new value you want to put. For example, to reset gold to zero for all characters with level higher than 70, you can use the following query: UPDATE `characters` SET `data`=CONCAT(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', 1397) AS CHAR), ' ', 0, ' ', CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(`data`, ' ', -131) AS CHAR)) WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX (`data`, ' ', 35), ' ', -1) AS UNSIGNED) > 70; Again, don't forget to backup first!! 3.3.5 Character Data Table This table was last updated for 3.3.5 values.

The `*_loot_template` tables General Well, according to vocabulary the meaning of the word \"loot\" is good for corpse loot and may be for some gameobjects like chests but quite unfit for fishing \"loot\". Nevermind. We will use term \"loot\" here as \"a set of items generated on an event for a player\" and \"loot definition\" as \"a set of rules for loot generation\". And forget about vocabulary for a while. This table format is used for 11 different tables to generate different loot items for different things. The 11 tables are creature_loot_template, disenchant_loot_template, fishing_loot_template, gameobject_loot_template, item_loot_template, pickpocketing_loot_template, prospecting_loot_template, skinning_loot_template, mail_loot_template, reference_loot_template, milling_loot_template. The general description here is valid for all 11 because the loot system is the same for all eleven. Loot templates define only items in the loot.

The rows with the same ID defines a single loot. It is often the same ID as the loot source (item, creature, etc) but when the link is made not on entry field of the Related table then ID can be different. For example, when several loot sources should provide the same loot, single loot definition can be used. In this case the loot sources have the same value in the link field. It is possible also to set up artificial loot templates which are not used directly at all as they have ID which are not referenced from the related source. Such \"support templates\" can be referenced from \"normal\" loot templates. When a common or artificial loot template is used a problem arises: what ID to use for that template? Depending on the loot table, different rules can be agreed on to simplify maintenance for the table. Moreover, such rules would be very handy but it seems at the moment there are very few rules explicitly defined. Agreements on entry field values are described there . item Template ID of the item which can be included into the loot. NOTE: For reference entries this field has no meaning and not used by the core in any way. Yet because of the PRIMARY KEY on the entry + item combination, this field will nonetheless need to be a unique number for each reference entry so that no indexing conflicts arise. ChanceOrQuestChance Meaning of that field is a bit different depending on its sign and the sign of mincountOrRef : Plain entry ChanceOrQuestChance > 0, mincountOrRef > 0 Absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance (actuallu just the value as it's positive in this case) signifies the percent chance that the item has to drop. Any floating point number is allowed but indeed any value larger that 100 will make the same result as 100. Quest drop ChanceOrQuestChance < 0, mincountOrRef > 0 Just as for plain entries absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance signifies the percent chance that the item has to drop. But in addition negative ChanceOrQuestChance informs the core that the item should be shown only to characters having appropriate quest. This means that even if item is dropped, in order to see it in the loot the player must have at least one quest that has the item ID in its ReqItemIdN fields or in its ReqSourceIdN fields. The player must also have less copies of the item than ReqItemCountN or ReqSourceCountN . Chanced references mincountOrRef < 0 For negative mincountOrRef ( reference entries ) ChanceOrQuestChance signifies the percent chance that the reference has to be used. So it is very similar to plain entries meaning, just note that entire reference is skipped if the chance is missed. Negative and zero values of ChanceOrQuestChance make no sense for that case and cannot be used. Common remarks Zero value of ChanceOrQuestChance is allowed for grouped entries only. (Non-zero) values of ChanceOrQuestChance in loot definition are multiplied by RATE_DROP_ITEMS (mangos config setting) during loot generation for references and non-reference entries, but not for grouped entries. groupid A group is a set of loot definitions processed in such a way that at any given looting event the loot generated can receive only 1 (or none) item from the items declared in the loot definitions of the group. Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields AND have MinCountOrRef > 0 . A group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance ) and equal-chanced ( ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: all equal-chanced entries have the same chance group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% Of course group may consist of only explicitly-chanced entries or only equal-chanced entries or entries of both type. The easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: At loading time: groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. During loot generation: core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry 'wins': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. otherwise the entry 'looses': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. Let us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). If you understand the process you can understand the results: Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance . If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R . So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance . That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. So now basic applications of the groups are clear: Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. A single group may be defined for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. There is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. Note: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. Note: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. Note: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16. mincountOrRef This field defines when positive: the minimum number of copies of the item that can drop in a single loot when negative: a reference to another template. Zero value makes no sense and should not be used. Meaning of positive values is quite clear and requires no additional comments. References can point to either a whole template or to single group of a template and decribed below. Template reference mincountOrRef < 0, group = 0 Template reference asks core to process another loot template (having entry equal to \"-mincountOrRef\") and to include all items dropped for that template into current loot. Simple idea. Value of maxcount field is used as a repetition factor for references - the reference will be processed not just once but exactly maxcount times. So if the referenced template can produce 3 to 10 items (depending on luck) and value of maxcount is '5' then after processing of that reference 15 to 50 items will be added to the loot. An awful example, isn't it? Actually no good example for whole template reference repetition is known, but it is quite useful for group references sometimes. Be careful. Self references (loot template includes reference to itself) and loop references (loot template A includes reference to entire template B, loot template B includes reference to entire template A) are completely different from internal references . If you make a self-reference like INSERT INTO `creature_loot_template` (`entry`,`item`,`mincountOrRef`) VALUES ('21215','0','-21215'); then the core will crash due to stack overflow at first attempt of loot 21215 processing. That is why self references and loop references are strictly forbidden . Filtered references mincountOrRef < 0, group > 0 Group reference asks core to process another loot template (having entry equal to \"-mincountOrRef\") only in the part of one group - with id equal to value of `groupid` field of the reference entry. So this reference may add only none or 1 item into the loot (provided maxcount is equal to 1). Meaning of maxcount field value is the same as described in Template reference . Note that there is no way to have a reference as a part of a group as such grouped reference would have the same format as reference to group described here. There are two types of group references: external reference when group reference row has entry different from entry of the referenced group internal reference when group reference row has the same entry as the referenced group. Basic usage of group references is to avoid repetition of group definitions when several loot sources have common parts of the loot. In this case it is possible: to define groups with the same contents (items/drop chances) again and again. The simpliest way, but very RAM consumable. to define the group once as a part of one of loot source loot definition and to include group references in loot definitions of the other loot sources instead of repeating group definition. to define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition (having entry not corresponding to any source) and to include group references in loot definitions for every related loot source. The first way is deprecated, both second and third use external references . UDB recommends to use the third way. As references have chance to be processed it is possible to use them effiently for zone or world drop definitions. Those drops often have different chances for different loot sources (low/high skill gameobjects, non-elite/elite creatures etc) while having the same contents of the loot. The recommended way to define such drops is as following: to set up a group with 100% group chance in an artificial loot template (using equal-chanced entries when possible) to include references to that group into loot definition of every related loot source setting the drop chance for the reference. Some bosses drop more than one tier item (two or three). Loot statistics looks like the same group is rolled 2 or 3 times and every time an item (possible the same) is chosen. It is simple to define a group for single item, but how to define drop for the second and the third? We can: repeat group definition 2 (or 3) times with change of group id define the group once and include 1 (or 2) internal references . define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include 2 (or 3) external group references. define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include an external group reference with repetition factor of 2 (or 3). The in-game results will be the same. But again - the first way is very inefficient and then deprecated. UDB recommends to use the forth way. maxcount For non-reference entries - the maximum number of copies of the item that can drop in a single loot. For references value of maxcount field is used as a repetition factor for references - the reference will be processed not just once but exactly maxcount times. This is designed to serve a single purpose: to make definition of tier token drops a bit simplier (tokens of a tier are defined as a 100-chance group of an artificial template and bosses' loot templates include 100-chanced reference to that group with repetition factor of 2 or 3 depending on the case). Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here). Note: core rolls chance for any loot definition entry just one time - so if a references looses its chance it is skipped for the current loot completely whatever is maxcount value. condition_id Value that represents a condition that must be met in order for the item to drop. See Conditions table for detailed description. Note: For reference entries only some conditions can be used Agreements These agreements are different for different loot tables. Mainly agreements defines rules for loot template IDs ( entry ) and groups Fishing haul For fishing_loot_template, ID is the zone or area ID from AreaTable.dbc (Note: Area IDs are not included in the link) Also an extra note on fishing_loot_template: if just one area ID is defined for a zone, then that whole zone ID is skipped and therefore all areas in that zone need to have entries in the table. Only when there doesn't exist any area entries for a zone does the core use the zone ID directly. Zone = Wetlands, Elwynn, etc; Area = Northshire, Lakeshire, etc. When several zones uses the same loot definition then the loot template of the zone with minimal ID (minID) should be defined without references the other zone with the same loot should have loot definition as a single reference to the minID loot definition Note: To be confirmed by UDB developers As successful fishing should give exactly 1 fish (with an exception for quest fishes) so non-quest part of every loot template should be or single plain entry with 100% drop chance or a single group with group chance equal to 100% or a reference to a template made according to previous two variants. It is recommended to use group references . When a fish is catched for a quest it becoms the second fish on the hook. Many people rolled on floor laughing but this is blizzlike and fortunately easy to implement. Just add necessary quest drop definition(s). Corpse loot For creature_loot_template basic approach is to use creature_template.lootid equal to creature_template.entry . But this results in great overhead in the loot table as many creatures use the same loot definition (well, stats on sites are similar due to the nature of random roll) even more creatures use same parts of loot definition That is why it is recommended to use grouping , group references and template references . Disenchant outcome Agreements for disenchant loot templates numbering is * item.level + item.quality where item is disenchanting target. As disenchanting should give exactly 1 type of shard/essence/dust/etc so every loot template should be or single plain entry with 100% drop chance or a single group with group chance equal to 100% There is no use for references here as the reference is done with the relation field. No quest drop at all. Gameobject harvest TBD Luggage contents TBD Pocket pick-ups Agreements for pickpocketing loot templates numbering is not known.

It's a real pity as many creatures should use the same templates. In most cases mobs with the same family and level have very similar skinning statistics. As skinning should give exactly 1 type of skin/hide/etc so every loot template should be or single plain entry with 100% drop chance or single group with group chance equal to 100% There is no use for references here as the reference is done with the relation field.

Groups are formed by loot definitions having the same values of entry and groupid fields AND have MinCountOrRef > 0 . A group may consists of explicitly-chanced (having non-zero ChanceOrQuestChance ) and equal-chanced ( ChanceOrQuestChance = 0) entries. Every equal-chanced entry of a group is considered having such a chance that: all equal-chanced entries have the same chance group chance (sum of chances of all entries) is 100% Of course group may consist of only explicitly-chanced entries or only equal-chanced entries or entries of both type. The easies way to understand what are groups is to understand how core processes grouped entries: At loading time: groups are formed - all grouped entries with the same values of groupid and entry fields are gathered into two sets - one for explicitly-chanced entries and one for equal-chanced. Note that order of entries in the sets can not be defined by DB - you should assume that the entries are in an unknown order. But indeed every time core processes a group the entries are in some order, constant during processing. During loot generation: core rolls for explicitly-chanced entries (if any): a random number R is rolled in range 0 to 100 (floating point value). chance to drop is checked for every (explicitly-chanced) entry in the group: if R is less than absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance of the entry then the entry 'wins': the item is included in the loot. Group processing stops, the rest of group entries are just skipped. otherwise the entry 'looses': the item misses its chance to get into the loot. R is decreased by the absolute value of ChanceOrQuestChance and next explicitly-chanced entry is checked. if none of explicitly-chanced entries got its chance then equal-chanced part (if any) is processed: a random entry is selected from the set of equal-chanced entries and corresponding item is included in the loot. If nothing selected yet (this never happens if the group has some equal-chanced entries) - no item from the group is included into the loot. Let us use term group chance as the sum of ChanceOrQuestChance (absolute) values for the group. Please note that even one equal-chanced entry makes group chance to be 100% (provided that sum of explicit chances does not exceed 100%). If you understand the process you can understand the results: Not more than one item from a group may drop at any given time. If group chance is at least 100 then one item will be dropped for sure. If group chance does not exceed 100 then every item defined in group entries has exactly that chance to drop as set in ChanceOrQuestChance . If group chance is greater than 100 then some entries will lost a part of their chance (or even not be checked at all - that will be the case for all equal-chanced entries) whatever value takes the roll R . So for some items chance to drop will be less than their ChanceOrQuestChance . That is very bad and that is why having group chance > 100 is strictly prohibited. Processing of equal-chanced part takes much less time then of explicitly-chanced one. So usage of equal-chanced groups is recommended when possible. So now basic applications of the groups are clear: Groups with group chance of 100% generate exactly one item every time. This is needed quite often, for example such behavior is needed to define a loot template for tier item drop from a boss. Groups with group chance < 100 generate one or zero items every time keeping chances of every item unchanged. Such behavior is useful to limit maximum number of items in the loot. A single group may be defined for a set of items common for several loot sources. This could be very useful for decreasing DB size without any loss of data. See References for more details. There is no way to have a reference as a part of a group. Note: A group may contain definitions of non-quest drop, quest drop or both, but mixing non-quest and quest drop in a single group is not recommended. Note: The core has a limitation - only 16 non-quest items (money and items added into the loot for quests are not counted for this \"16\") may come into the loot. And this is not a caprice of core devs - the client has some constraints. As most of loots have much more than 16 possible items (sometimes several hundreds) so without groups there is a (little) chance that more than 16 items will be rolled for a given loot but player will be able to see (and take) only first 16 of them. With groups you can ensure that more than 16 items will never drop. If DB pretends to be a quality software it must have loot template definitions which ensure that not more than 16 plain entries and groups are defined for any loot template. This is just a note - such declaration is not issued by UDB developers yet. Note: The core has no limitation for number of groups (except 255 by DB field size), but according to the previous note there is no need to use values greater than 16.","title":"groupid"},{"location":"DB-Structure/Core/Loot_Template/#mincountorref","text":"This field defines when positive: the minimum number of copies of the item that can drop in a single loot when negative: a reference to another template.

Simple idea. Value of maxcount field is used as a repetition factor for references - the reference will be processed not just once but exactly maxcount times. So if the referenced template can produce 3 to 10 items (depending on luck) and value of maxcount is '5' then after processing of that reference 15 to 50 items will be added to the loot. An awful example, isn't it? Actually no good example for whole template reference repetition is known, but it is quite useful for group references sometimes. Be careful. Self references (loot template includes reference to itself) and loop references (loot template A includes reference to entire template B, loot template B includes reference to entire template A) are completely different from internal references . If you make a self-reference like INSERT INTO `creature_loot_template` (`entry`,`item`,`mincountOrRef`) VALUES ('21215','0','-21215'); then the core will crash due to stack overflow at first attempt of loot 21215 processing.

So this reference may add only none or 1 item into the loot (provided maxcount is equal to 1). Meaning of maxcount field value is the same as described in Template reference . Note that there is no way to have a reference as a part of a group as such grouped reference would have the same format as reference to group described here. There are two types of group references: external reference when group reference row has entry different from entry of the referenced group internal reference when group reference row has the same entry as the referenced group. Basic usage of group references is to avoid repetition of group definitions when several loot sources have common parts of the loot. In this case it is possible: to define groups with the same contents (items/drop chances) again and again. The simpliest way, but very RAM consumable. to define the group once as a part of one of loot source loot definition and to include group references in loot definitions of the other loot sources instead of repeating group definition. to define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition (having entry not corresponding to any source) and to include group references in loot definitions for every related loot source. The first way is deprecated, both second and third use external references . UDB recommends to use the third way. As references have chance to be processed it is possible to use them effiently for zone or world drop definitions. Those drops often have different chances for different loot sources (low/high skill gameobjects, non-elite/elite creatures etc) while having the same contents of the loot. The recommended way to define such drops is as following: to set up a group with 100% group chance in an artificial loot template (using equal-chanced entries when possible) to include references to that group into loot definition of every related loot source setting the drop chance for the reference. Some bosses drop more than one tier item (two or three). Loot statistics looks like the same group is rolled 2 or 3 times and every time an item (possible the same) is chosen. It is simple to define a group for single item, but how to define drop for the second and the third? We can: repeat group definition 2 (or 3) times with change of group id define the group once and include 1 (or 2) internal references . define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include 2 (or 3) external group references. define the group once as a part of an artificial loot definition and include an external group reference with repetition factor of 2 (or 3). The in-game results will be the same. But again - the first way is very inefficient and then deprecated.

Using non-1 repetition factor for other things (references to a group with group chance less than 100% or chanced references with chance less than 100%) must be agreed with UDB devs first (and described here).

The script is called EventAI and will be referenced like this for the rest of this guide. A basic EventAI script works with and requires only two pieces of information: When it happens and What happens when . The first piece of information (the When it happens ) will be referred to as the event . The second piece of information (the What happens when ) will be referred to as the action . Currently, a single EventAI script entry can have up to three actions. Anyone that wants to create entries for the EventAI script needs to answer the two questions above. Some events will only occur once while others can be timed so that they occur at a specified interval. Structure Field Type Null Key Default Description id NO PRI None Primary Key creature_id NO CreatureEntry event_type NO Event event_inverse_phase_mask NO PhaseMask event_chance NO Chance. Using a value of 0 in this field will make the event never occur. Values are from 0 to 100. event_flags NO Every event also has a chance field that controls the chance of that event actually occurring. Using a value of 0 in this field will make the event never occur. Values are from 0 to 100. event_param NO event_param1-3 for Event action_type NO action_type1-3 for Event action_param NO action_param1-3 for action_type1-3 comment comment describing the actions performed on event Example: let's say that a certain creature using EventAI will have a max of four phases. We are then dealing with a 4 bit number in this field. Let's further say that that certain creature has an event that will only trigger in its phase 2 (a timed spell cast for instance). Then the field should contain all of the phases the event SHOULDN'T be triggered in...then out of the four bits, we leave the third bit alone (off) and turn on all of the other bits so we get 1011 which is equal to 11, so we put in 11 as the inverse phase mask for the event entry. As another example, let's say that the same creature previously mentioned has another event that is only triggered in the phase 0 and phase 3. This would mean that we need to ignore phase 1 and 2, so our bitmask would be 0110 which is equal to 6 so we put in 6 for this event's inverse phase mask field. Please note that both examples were tailored for a creature with four and only four phases. If you decide to add more phases later on, you will have to redefine all of the nonzero bitmasks for all of the mob's events. EventAI can also support phases. A phase is just a way to group certain events + actions together so that the creature will perform certain actions based on what event it is currently on. The way the phase system works in EventAI is that for every event added, it needs to be specified under which phases the event SHOULD NOT occur. This is a bit confusing at first, so let's look at it more closely. A creature can have more than one phase, up to a max of 32 different phases (with the first one being phase 0, and last one being phase 31). How the phase selection field works is that it contains a 32bit number. Each bit in the number represents a possible phase, with the bit in the least significant position signifying phase 0 and the most significant bit signifying phase 31. The default value of zero in this field has no bits set and since the field controls when the event should NOT trigger, it would then mean that the event will always be triggered independent of the current phase the creature is in. Therefore, if you want to specify what phases the event should occur in, you need to add up all of the corresponding bits for all the other phases where the event shouldn't trigger in (confusing...yes). All of the events , EventFlags , actions and possible targets are summarized and described below.

Each event can take up to three actions. The actions will all be performed when the event is triggered and they will be performed in the order that they have been defined. This means that, for a certain event, action 1 will be performed first, followed by action 2, then lastly by action 3. Just like event definitions, each action can use up to three different parameters but not all actions will use all three parameters.

It automatically reverts itself on evade. It works in connection with its modes, and automatically changes chase distance. A main casting spell, which is supposed to be lowest in priority (highest ID), needs to use 256 cast flag. This notes that when this spell returns OOM error, ranged mode automatically adjusts its behaviour. Ranged mode also responds to kicks and silence on this spell. Last notable feature with ranged mode is distancing, which only occurs if cast flag 1024 is set, and when creature is in melee mode, and the target is hit, creature runs away from main aggro targets melee reach.","title":"Creature ai scripts"},{"location":"DB-Structure/Core/creature_ai_scripts/#eventai-tables","text":"creature_ai_scripts for EventAI (ACID) scripted NPCs creature_ai_summons for Summon IDs used in ACTION_T_SUMMON_ID (32) creature_ai_texts for Texts used by ACTION_T_TEXT (1) and ACTION_T_TEXT_NEW (54)","title":"EventAI Tables"},{"location":"DB-Structure/Core/creature_ai_scripts/#eventai-documentation","text":"The Manual-like and most-recent documentation for EventAI can be found in doc/EventAI.txt","title":"EventAI Documentation"},{"location":"DB-Structure/Core/creature_ai_scripts/#eventai-guide","text":"ScriptDev2 was integrated into cmangos on 04 sept 2015 and enables us to handle DB-based scripting that allows the use of a database (MySQL only right now) to specify the actions that a creature script will do. The script is called EventAI and will be referenced like this for the rest of this guide. A basic EventAI script works with and requires only two pieces of information: When it happens and What happens when . The first piece of information (the When it happens ) will be referred to as the event . The second piece of information (the What happens when ) will be referred to as the action . Currently, a single EventAI script entry can have up to three actions. Anyone that wants to create entries for the EventAI script needs to answer the two questions above. Some events will only occur once while others can be timed so that they occur at a specified interval.","title":"EventAI Guide"},{"location":"DB-Structure/Core/creature_ai_scripts/#structure","text":"Field Type Null Key Default Description id NO PRI None Primary Key creature_id NO CreatureEntry event_type NO Event event_inverse_phase_mask NO PhaseMask event_chance NO Chance.

Values are from 0 to 100. event_param NO event_param1-3 for Event action_type NO action_type1-3 for Event action_param NO action_param1-3 for action_type1-3 comment comment describing the actions performed on event Example: let's say that a certain creature using EventAI will have a max of four phases. We are then dealing with a 4 bit number in this field. Let's further say that that certain creature has an event that will only trigger in its phase 2 (a timed spell cast for instance). Then the field should contain all of the phases the event SHOULDN'T be triggered in...then out of the four bits, we leave the third bit alone (off) and turn on all of the other bits so we get 1011 which is equal to 11, so we put in 11 as the inverse phase mask for the event entry. As another example, let's say that the same creature previously mentioned has another event that is only triggered in the phase 0 and phase 3. This would mean that we need to ignore phase 1 and 2, so our bitmask would be 0110 which is equal to 6 so we put in 6 for this event's inverse phase mask field. Please note that both examples were tailored for a creature with four and only four phases. If you decide to add more phases later on, you will have to redefine all of the nonzero bitmasks for all of the mob's events. EventAI can also support phases. A phase is just a way to group certain events + actions together so that the creature will perform certain actions based on what event it is currently on. The way the phase system works in EventAI is that for every event added, it needs to be specified under which phases the event SHOULD NOT occur. This is a bit confusing at first, so let's look at it more closely. A creature can have more than one phase, up to a max of 32 different phases (with the first one being phase 0, and last one being phase 31). How the phase selection field works is that it contains a 32bit number. Each bit in the number represents a possible phase, with the bit in the least significant position signifying phase 0 and the most significant bit signifying phase 31. The default value of zero in this field has no bits set and since the field controls when the event should NOT trigger, it would then mean that the event will always be triggered independent of the current phase the creature is in. Therefore, if you want to specify what phases the event should occur in, you need to add up all of the corresponding bits for all the other phases where the event shouldn't trigger in (confusing...yes). All of the events , EventFlags , actions and possible targets are summarized and described below.

It automatically reverts itself on evade. It works in connection with its modes, and automatically changes chase distance. A main casting spell, which is supposed to be lowest in priority (highest ID), needs to use 256 cast flag. This notes that when this spell returns OOM error, ranged mode automatically adjusts its behaviour. Ranged mode also responds to kicks and silence on this spell.

This Field is a Critical Value That Dictates An NPC's Base Stats System. An NPC's Unit Class Is A Corner Stone Value Used In Creature_Template_Classlevelstats To Determine An NPC's Stats. NPC Stats Refers To: (Health/Mana/Damage/Armor). In WOTLK and CATA There Are 4 Possible NPC Classes Available For Creatures: (Class: 1,2,4,8) In Classic and TBC There Are 3 Possible NPC Classes Available For Creatures: (Class: 1,2,8) ID Name CLASS_WARRIOR 1 CLASS_PALADIN 2 CLASS_ROGUE 4 CLASS_MAGE 8 This Value is Contained in Sniff Data: UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0 located in SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT It is a Critical Field in Determining Class Level Stats For the NPC. NOTE: Typically ONLY Vehicles Are Class=4 Warriors: Do Not Have Mana and Maximum Health and Damage Paladins: Have a Small Amount Of Mana and Slightly Less Health and Damage From a Warrior Rogues: (Little is Known Currently But They All Seem To Be Vehicles) Mages: Have Lots of Mana But Have Very Low Health and Damage Rank This Field Determines The Rank of the NPC - enum CreatureEliteType: Rank Name Comments 0 CREATURE_ELITE_NORMAL Normal 1 CREATURE_ELITE_ELITE Elite - Higher damage, more health, better loot. 2 CREATURE_ELITE_RAREELITE Rare Elite - A rare mob but with elite damage and health. 3 CREATURE_ELITE_WORLDBOSS World Boss - Highest rank, best loot, longest respawn time. 4 CREATURE_ELITE_RARE Rare - Somewhat better loot, longer respawn time. 5 CREATURE_UNKNOWN unkown - found in 2.2.3 for 2 mobs Expansion This Field Determines The Expansion Value of the NPC: This Value Is a Critical Value in Determining an NPC's Stats From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats And Directly Affects An NPC's Health and Damage. Value Expansion 0 Classic 1 Burning Crusades 2 Wrath of the Lich King 3 Cataclysm NOTE: Now Everyone Has Trouble Understanding This Concept. An NPC's Expansion Value Has NOTHING To Do With What Expansion An NPC Is From. This Value Determines How Difficult An NPC Is In Regards To An NPC At The Same Level From A Different Expansion. As An Example a Classic Level 60 NPC Will Have Less Base Health and Less Base Damage Then A Level 60 TBC NPC. Each Expansion Value Has a Different Base Health and Base Damage (Each Expansion Having Higher Values Then The Previous). ONLY Health And Damage Scale With Expansion Values. Mana / Armor / Attack Power Are Static Values For All Expansions For A Particular Level and Unit Class combination. An NPC's Health and Damage Is Calculated From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats Based On HealthMultiplier And DamageMultiplier Multiplied By BaseHealthExp? and BaseDamageExp? From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats Where ? = Expansion Value. Note: See Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats For Better Understanding. HealthMultiplier This Value Comes From WDB and Sniff Data. This Is The PRIMARY DB Value That Calculates An NPC's Specific Health Value. NPC Have Various HealthMultipliers But Typically They Are Fairly Rounded Values (Note: Dungeon/Raid/World Bosses Normally Have Large Very Rounded Values Normally) This Is The Multiplier Used Against The BaseHealthExp? Value From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats To Calculate An NPC's Final Health Values. ? = Expansion Value. Formula: MinLevelHealth = ROUND (BaseHealthExp? * HealthMultiplier) MaxLevelHealth = ROUND (BaseHealthExp? * HealthMultiplier) Example: Field Value Comments Entry 871 Saltscale Warrior MinLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MaxLevel 36 (Sniff Data) MinLevelHealth 1403 (Sniff Data) MaxLevelHealth 1469 (Sniff Data) UnitClass 1 (Sniff Data) Expansion 0 Determined From Calculations / Sniff Data / MoP DBC HealthMultiplier 1.15 (Sniff Data) Level 35 BaseHealthExp0: 1220 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseHealth Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) Level 36 BaseHealthExp0: 1277 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseHealth Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) MinLevelHealth = ROUND (1220*1.15) = 1403 (1403) MaxLevelHealth = ROUND (1277*1.15) = 1468.55 (1469) PowerMultiplier This Value Comes From WDB and Sniff Data. This Is The PRIMARY DB Value That Calculates An NPC's Specific Mana Value. All NPC Have Nice Rounded Values For PowerMultipliers. This Is The Multiplier Used Against The BaseMana Value From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats To Calculate An NPC's Final Mana Values. Note: BaseMana Values Do NOT Scale With Expansion Values Unlike Health And Damage. Note: For NPC that use Other Power then Mana it will reflect that power instead. Formula: MinLevelMana = ROUND (BaseMana * ManaMultiplier) MaxLevelMana = ROUND (BaseMana * ManaMultiplier) Example: Field Value Comments Entry 7335 Death's Head Geomancer MinLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MaxLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MinLevelMana 5360 (Sniff Data) MaxLevelMana 5360 (Sniff Data) UnitClass 8 (Sniff Data) Expansion 0 Determined From Calculations / Sniff Data / MoP DBC PowerMultiplier 2 (Sniff Data) Level 35 BaseMana: 2680 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseMana Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) MinLevelMana = ROUND (2680*2) = 5360 (5360) MaxLevelMana = ROUND (2680*2) = 5360 (5360) DamageMultiplier This field is the PRIMARY Field for adjusting and setting the Min/Max Damage Values for an NPC. Damage Calculation Formulas MIN MELEE DAMAGE = (((Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseDamageExp? * Creature_Template.DamageVariance) + (Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseMeleeAttackPower / 14)) * (Creature_Template.BaseMeleeAttackTime / 1000)) * Creature_Template.Dmg_Multiplier MAX MELEE DAMAGE = ((((Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseDamageExp? * Creature_Template.DamageVariance) * 1.5) + (Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseMeleeAttackPower / 14)) * (Creature_Template.BaseMeleeAttackTime / 1000)) * Creature_Template.Dmg_Multiplier Note: ? = Expansion Value of The NPC Some NPC Have Damage Multipliers Applied To Increase Their Damage Above That Of a Normal NPC Of The Same Level. I am sure people are asking... WHY is there more then just a simple Damage Multiplier Involved To Boost NPC Damage? Here is the only logical answer. With some NPC (Like Bosses) Who have Multipliers in the range of 20 - 75 Min and Max Damage values can fluctuate into VERY Large Ranges. So What Blizz has done is create a Co-Efficient System of 2 Values to help Reign in Max Damage Values so if you require a Set Min/Max Damage For an NPC it can scale the BaseDamage so after being put though the Formula The Min and Max Damage values will be within the Required Range. Damage Variance is used to reduce the Max Damage Value. For NPC Who Do NOT Have an altered Damage Variance the Default Value used is 1 (Normal Variance = 1). Here is an Example of an NPC Melee Damage Calculation Nexus-Prince Shaffar = Unit Class 2 (BOSS) Level 66: BaseDamage = 78.472 / Melee AttackPower = 266 / Base Melee Attack Time = 2000 Bestiary Min Dmg: 1136 Bestiary Max Dmg: 1593 Damage Variance: 1.0 (No Variance) Damage Multiplier: 5.83 (Calculated Value) CalculatedMinMeleeDmg=ROUND(((BaseDamage * Damage Variance) + (Base Melee Attackpower / 14)) * (Base Attack Time/1000)) * Damage Multiplier = ((((78.472 * 1.0) + (266/14)) * (2000/1000)) * 5.83 = (((78.472) + 19) * 2) = 194.944 * 5.83 = 1136.52352 CalculatedMaxMeleeDmg=ROUND((((BaseDamage * Damage Variance) * 1.5) + (Base Melee Attack Power / 14)) * (Base Attack Time/1000)) * Damage Multiplier = ((((78.472 * 1.0) * 1.5) + (266/14)) * (2000/1000)) * 5.83 = (((117.708) + 19) * 2) = 273.416 * 5.83 = 1594.01528 NOTE: Very Slight Rounding Errors of 1 or 2 Damage Might Occur... This was due to Rounding When Generating BaseDamage Values in Calculations. DamageVariance Damage Variance is a Co-Efficient used in Damage Calculations To Limit the Min/Max Damage Range.

This Value Comes From Sniff Packet Data. Note: This field should only be used as an override if the model's default SpeedWalk is not correct for the creature_template.entry. ( creature_model_info.SpeedWalk ) `SpeedWalk` = (sniffed value / 2.5) (Default Value Is: 1) SpeedRun This Field Controls How Fast An NPC Moves When Running. This Value Comes From Sniff Packet Data. Note: This field should only be used as an override if the model's default SpeedRun is not correct for the creature_template.entry. ( creature_model_info.SpeedRun ) `SpeedRun` = (sniffed value / 7) (Default Value Is: 1.14286) UnitClass The NPC Unit Class. This Field is a Critical Value That Dictates An NPC's Base Stats System. An NPC's Unit Class Is A Corner Stone Value Used In Creature_Template_Classlevelstats To Determine An NPC's Stats. NPC Stats Refers To: (Health/Mana/Damage/Armor). In WOTLK and CATA There Are 4 Possible NPC Classes Available For Creatures: (Class: 1,2,4,8) In Classic and TBC There Are 3 Possible NPC Classes Available For Creatures: (Class: 1,2,8) ID Name CLASS_WARRIOR 1 CLASS_PALADIN 2 CLASS_ROGUE 4 CLASS_MAGE 8 This Value is Contained in Sniff Data: UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0 located in SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT It is a Critical Field in Determining Class Level Stats For the NPC. NOTE: Typically ONLY Vehicles Are Class=4 Warriors: Do Not Have Mana and Maximum Health and Damage Paladins: Have a Small Amount Of Mana and Slightly Less Health and Damage From a Warrior Rogues: (Little is Known Currently But They All Seem To Be Vehicles) Mages: Have Lots of Mana But Have Very Low Health and Damage Rank This Field Determines The Rank of the NPC: Rank Name Comments 0 Normal 1 Elite Higher damage, more health, better loot. 2 Rare Elite A rare mob but with elite damage and health. 3 World Boss Highest rank, best loot, longest respawn time. 4 Rare Somewhat better loot, longer respawn time. HealthMultiplier This Value Comes From WDB and Sniff Data. This Is The PRIMARY DB Value That Calculates An NPC's Specific Health Value. NPC Have Various HealthMultipliers But Typically They Are Fairly Rounded Values (Note: Dungeon/Raid/World Bosses Normally Have Large Very Rounded Values Normally) This Is The Multiplier Used Against The BaseHealthExp? Value From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats To Calculate An NPC's Final Health Values. Formula: MinLevelHealth = ROUND (BaseHealthExp? * HealthMultiplier) MaxLevelHealth = ROUND (BaseHealthExp? * HealthMultiplier) Example: Field Value Comments Entry 871 Saltscale Warrior MinLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MaxLevel 36 (Sniff Data) MinLevelHealth 1403 (Sniff Data) MaxLevelHealth 1469 (Sniff Data) UnitClass 1 (Sniff Data) HealthMultiplier 1.15 (Sniff Data) Level 35 BaseHealthExp0: 1220 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseHealth Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) Level 36 BaseHealthExp0: 1277 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseHealth Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) MinLevelHealth = ROUND (1220*1.15) = 1403 (1403) MaxLevelHealth = ROUND (1277*1.15) = 1468.55 (1469) PowerMultiplier This Value Comes From WDB and Sniff Data. This Is The PRIMARY DB Value That Calculates An NPC's Specific Mana Value. All NPC Have Nice Rounded Values For PowerMultipliers. This Is The Multiplier Used Against The BaseMana Value From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats To Calculate An NPC's Final Mana Values. Note: BaseMana Values Do NOT Scale With Expansion Values Unlike Health And Damage. Note: For NPC that use Other Power then Mana it will reflect that power instead. Formula: MinLevelMana = ROUND (BaseMana * ManaMultiplier) MaxLevelMana = ROUND (BaseMana * ManaMultiplier) Example: Field Value Comments Entry 7335 Death's Head Geomancer MinLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MaxLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MinLevelMana 5360 (Sniff Data) MaxLevelMana 5360 (Sniff Data) UnitClass 8 (Sniff Data) PowerMultiplier 2 (Sniff Data) Level 35 BaseMana: 2680 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseMana Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) MinLevelMana = ROUND (2680*2) = 5360 (5360) MaxLevelMana = ROUND (2680*2) = 5360 (5360) DamageMultiplier This field is the PRIMARY Field for adjusting and setting the Min/Max Damage Values for an NPC. Damage Calculation Formulas MIN MELEE DAMAGE = (((Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseDamageExp? * Creature_Template.DamageVariance) + (Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseMeleeAttackPower / 14)) * (Creature_Template.BaseMeleeAttackTime / 1000)) * Creature_Template.Dmg_Multiplier MAX MELEE DAMAGE = ((((Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseDamageExp? * Creature_Template.DamageVariance) * 1.5) + (Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseMeleeAttackPower / 14)) * (Creature_Template.BaseMeleeAttackTime / 1000)) * Creature_Template.Dmg_Multiplier Some NPC Have Damage Multipliers Applied To Increase Their Damage Above That Of a Normal NPC Of The Same Level. I am sure people are asking... WHY is there more then just a simple Damage Multiplier Involved To Boost NPC Damage? Here is the only logical answer. With some NPC (Like Bosses) Who have Multipliers in the range of 20 - 75 Min and Max Damage values can fluctuate into VERY Large Ranges. So What Blizz has done is create a Co-Efficient System of 2 Values to help Reign in Max Damage Values so if you require a Set Min/Max Damage For an NPC it can scale the BaseDamage so after being put though the Formula The Min and Max Damage values will be within the Required Range. Damage Variance is used to reduce the Max Damage Value. For NPC Who Do NOT Have an altered Damage Variance the Default Value used is 1 (Normal Variance = 1). Here is an Example of an NPC Melee Damage Calculation Nexus-Prince Shaffar = Unit Class 2 (BOSS) Level 66: BaseDamage = 78.472 / Melee AttackPower = 266 / Base Melee Attack Time = 2000 Bestiary Min Dmg: 1136 Bestiary Max Dmg: 1593 Damage Variance: 1.0 (No Variance) Damage Multiplier: 5.83 (Calculated Value) CalculatedMinMeleeDmg=ROUND(((BaseDamage * Damage Variance) + (Base Melee Attackpower / 14)) * (Base Attack Time/1000)) * Damage Multiplier = ((((78.472 * 1.0) + (266/14)) * (2000/1000)) * 5.83 = (((78.472) + 19) * 2) = 194.944 * 5.83 = 1136.52352 CalculatedMaxMeleeDmg=ROUND((((BaseDamage * Damage Variance) * 1.5) + (Base Melee Attack Power / 14)) * (Base Attack Time/1000)) * Damage Multiplier = ((((78.472 * 1.0) * 1.5) + (266/14)) * (2000/1000)) * 5.83 = (((117.708) + 19) * 2) = 273.416 * 5.83 = 1594.01528 NOTE: Very Slight Rounding Errors of 1 or 2 Damage Might Occur... This was due to Rounding When Generating BaseDamage Values in Calculations. DamageVariance Damage Variance is a Co-Efficient used in Damage Calculations To Limit the Min/Max Damage Range.

Note: This field should only be used as an override if the model's default SpeedRun is not correct for the creature_template.entry.

This Field is a Critical Value That Dictates An NPC's Base Stats System. An NPC's Unit Class Is A Corner Stone Value Used In Creature_Template_Classlevelstats To Determine An NPC's Stats. NPC Stats Refers To: (Health/Mana/Damage/Armor). In WOTLK and CATA There Are 4 Possible NPC Classes Available For Creatures: (Class: 1,2,4,8) In Classic and TBC There Are 3 Possible NPC Classes Available For Creatures: (Class: 1,2,8) ID Name CLASS_WARRIOR 1 CLASS_PALADIN 2 CLASS_ROGUE 4 CLASS_MAGE 8 This Value is Contained in Sniff Data: UNIT_FIELD_BYTES_0 located in SMSG_UPDATE_OBJECT It is a Critical Field in Determining Class Level Stats For the NPC. NOTE: Typically ONLY Vehicles Are Class=4 Warriors: Do Not Have Mana and Maximum Health and Damage Paladins: Have a Small Amount Of Mana and Slightly Less Health and Damage From a Warrior Rogues: (Little is Known Currently But They All Seem To Be Vehicles) Mages: Have Lots of Mana But Have Very Low Health and Damage Rank This Field Determines The Rank of the NPC: Rank Name Comments 0 Normal 1 Elite Higher damage, more health, better loot. 2 Rare Elite A rare mob but with elite damage and health. 3 World Boss Highest rank, best loot, longest respawn time. 4 Rare Somewhat better loot, longer respawn time. Expansion This Field Determines The Expansion Value of the NPC: This Value Is a Critical Value in Determining an NPC's Stats From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats And Directly Affects An NPC's Health and Damage. Value Expansion 0 Classic 1 Burning Crusades 2 Wrath of the Lich King 3 Cataclysm NOTE: Now Everyone Has Trouble Understanding This Concept. An NPC's Expansion Value Has NOTHING To Do With What Expansion An NPC Is From. This Value Determines How Difficult An NPC Is In Regards To An NPC At The Same Level From A Different Expansion. As An Example a Classic Level 60 NPC Will Have Less Base Health and Less Base Damage Then A Level 60 TBC NPC. Each Expansion Value Has a Different Base Health and Base Damage (Each Expansion Having Higher Values Then The Previous). ONLY Health And Damage Scale With Expansion Values. Mana / Armor / Attack Power Are Static Values For All Expansions For A Particular Level and Unit Class combination. An NPC's Health and Damage Is Calculated From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats Based On HealthMultiplier And DamageMultiplier Multiplied By BaseHealthExp? and BaseDamageExp? From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats Where ? = Expansion Value. Note: See Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats For Better Understanding. HealthMultiplier This Value Comes From WDB and Sniff Data. This Is The PRIMARY DB Value That Calculates An NPC's Specific Health Value. NPC Have Various HealthMultipliers But Typically They Are Fairly Rounded Values (Note: Dungeon/Raid/World Bosses Normally Have Large Very Rounded Values Normally) This Is The Multiplier Used Against The BaseHealthExp? Value From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats To Calculate An NPC's Final Health Values. ? = Expansion Value. Formula: MinLevelHealth = ROUND (BaseHealthExp? * HealthMultiplier) MaxLevelHealth = ROUND (BaseHealthExp? * HealthMultiplier) Example: Field Value Comments Entry 871 Saltscale Warrior MinLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MaxLevel 36 (Sniff Data) MinLevelHealth 1403 (Sniff Data) MaxLevelHealth 1469 (Sniff Data) UnitClass 1 (Sniff Data) Expansion 0 Determined From Calculations / Sniff Data / MoP DBC HealthMultiplier 1.15 (Sniff Data) Level 35 BaseHealthExp0: 1220 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseHealth Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) Level 36 BaseHealthExp0: 1277 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseHealth Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) MinLevelHealth = ROUND (1220*1.15) = 1403 (1403) MaxLevelHealth = ROUND (1277*1.15) = 1468.55 (1469) PowerMultiplier This Value Comes From WDB and Sniff Data. This Is The PRIMARY DB Value That Calculates An NPC's Specific Mana Value. All NPC Have Nice Rounded Values For PowerMultipliers. This Is The Multiplier Used Against The BaseMana Value From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats To Calculate An NPC's Final Mana Values. Note: BaseMana Values Do NOT Scale With Expansion Values Unlike Health And Damage. Note: For NPC that use Other Power then Mana it will reflect that power instead. Formula: MinLevelMana = ROUND (BaseMana * ManaMultiplier) MaxLevelMana = ROUND (BaseMana * ManaMultiplier) Example: Field Value Comments Entry 7335 Death's Head Geomancer MinLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MaxLevel 35 (Sniff Data) MinLevelMana 5360 (Sniff Data) MaxLevelMana 5360 (Sniff Data) UnitClass 8 (Sniff Data) Expansion 0 Determined From Calculations / Sniff Data / MoP DBC PowerMultiplier 2 (Sniff Data) Level 35 BaseMana: 2680 (From Creature_Template_ClassLevelStats - BaseMana Values Calculated From Sniff Data And Extensive Research) MinLevelMana = ROUND (2680*2) = 5360 (5360) MaxLevelMana = ROUND (2680*2) = 5360 (5360) DamageMultiplier This field is the PRIMARY Field for adjusting and setting the Min/Max Damage Values for an NPC. Damage Calculation Formulas MIN MELEE DAMAGE = (((Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseDamageExp? * Creature_Template.DamageVariance) + (Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseMeleeAttackPower / 14)) * (Creature_Template.BaseMeleeAttackTime / 1000)) * Creature_Template.Dmg_Multiplier MAX MELEE DAMAGE = ((((Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseDamageExp? * Creature_Template.DamageVariance) * 1.5) + (Creature_Template_Classlevelstats.BaseMeleeAttackPower / 14)) * (Creature_Template.BaseMeleeAttackTime / 1000)) * Creature_Template.Dmg_Multiplier Note: ? = Expansion Value of The NPC Some NPC Have Damage Multipliers Applied To Increase Their Damage Above That Of a Normal NPC Of The Same Level. I am sure people are asking... WHY is there more then just a simple Damage Multiplier Involved To Boost NPC Damage? Here is the only logical answer. With some NPC (Like Bosses) Who have Multipliers in the range of 20 - 75 Min and Max Damage values can fluctuate into VERY Large Ranges. So What Blizz has done is create a Co-Efficient System of 2 Values to help Reign in Max Damage Values so if you require a Set Min/Max Damage For an NPC it can scale the BaseDamage so after being put though the Formula The Min and Max Damage values will be within the Required Range. Damage Variance is used to reduce the Max Damage Value. For NPC Who Do NOT Have an altered Damage Variance the Default Value used is 1 (Normal Variance = 1). Here is an Example of an NPC Melee Damage Calculation Nexus-Prince Shaffar = Unit Class 2 (BOSS) Level 66: BaseDamage = 78.472 / Melee AttackPower = 266 / Base Melee Attack Time = 2000 Bestiary Min Dmg: 1136 Bestiary Max Dmg: 1593 Damage Variance: 1.0 (No Variance) Damage Multiplier: 5.83 (Calculated Value) CalculatedMinMeleeDmg=ROUND(((BaseDamage * Damage Variance) + (Base Melee Attackpower / 14)) * (Base Attack Time/1000)) * Damage Multiplier = ((((78.472 * 1.0) + (266/14)) * (2000/1000)) * 5.83 = (((78.472) + 19) * 2) = 194.944 * 5.83 = 1136.52352 CalculatedMaxMeleeDmg=ROUND((((BaseDamage * Damage Variance) * 1.5) + (Base Melee Attack Power / 14)) * (Base Attack Time/1000)) * Damage Multiplier = ((((78.472 * 1.0) * 1.5) + (266/14)) * (2000/1000)) * 5.83 = (((117.708) + 19) * 2) = 273.416 * 5.83 = 1594.01528 NOTE: Very Slight Rounding Errors of 1 or 2 Damage Might Occur... This was due to Rounding When Generating BaseDamage Values in Calculations. DamageVariance Damage Variance is a Co-Efficient used in Damage Calculations To Limit the Min/Max Damage Range.

With some NPC (Like Bosses) Who have Multipliers in the range of 20 - 75 Min and Max Damage values can fluctuate into VERY Large Ranges. So What Blizz has done is create a Co-Efficient System of 2 Values to help Reign in Max Damage Values so if you require a Set Min/Max Damage For an NPC it can scale the BaseDamage so after being put though the Formula The Min and Max Damage values will be within the Required Range.

See creature_template.entry . For dbscripts_on_creature_movement , it is the script id of the waypoint. The PROPER formatting for the ID field is as follows: Creature_entry + 2-Digit Script ID (Starting at 01). Example: c.2386 has few movement_scripts, so 2386+01 = 238601 ... 23602 ..etc For dbscripts_on_event , it is the event ID. There doesn't exist currently a full list of events.

For dbscripts_on_gossip , it is the action script id of the gossip option. For dbscripts_on_promo_code_use , it is the ? For dbscripts_on_quest_end , it is the ID that is used in CompleteScript in the quest template definition.

Also see RequiredSkillValue ) Value is ID from QuestSort.dbc. QuestSort.dbc RequiredSkill This field defines any specific skill requirements for the quest to be available for a character. If value > 0 then value is a skill ID (see SkillLine.dbc) MinLevel Minimum level required to get the quest. QuestLevel Level of quest. Player receives full experience amount only if their level is less than or equal to QuestLevel+5. If QuestLevel = -1, the quest uses current player level as its level.

RequiredMaxRepFaction The Faction ID for the faction that controls the maximum reputation value that the player can have and still get the quest. See Faction.dbc RequiredMaxRepValue The maximum reputation value that the player can have with a faction and still get the quest. If the player has more reputation than the value in this field, the quest will not be able to be taken anymore. SuggestedPlayers Info about how many players should do unite for the quest. LimitTime Time in seconds that the player has to complete this quest. QuestFlags This flag field defines more specifically the type of quest it is. Aside from the daily flag and sharable flag, this field is used just for grouping purposes and NOT for any other quest requirements. The quest requirements are calculated from non-zero values in other quest template fields. Also, while some of these flags are known, others have yet an unknown purpose and the comments below is simply guesswork on them. At the moment (rev 6055), the core does not actually handle these flags any differently (again, except for the daily flag and the sharable flag). Bit Name Comments 0 QUEST_FLAGS_NONE No flags, so no groups assigned to this quest. 1 QUEST_FLAGS_STAY_ALIVE If the player dies, the quest is failed. (?) 2 QUEST_FLAGS_EVENT Escort quests or any other event-driven quests. If player in party, all players that can accept this quest will receive confirmation box to accept quest. 4 QUEST_FLAGS_EXPLORATION Involves the activation of an areatrigger. 8 QUEST_FLAGS_SHARABLE Allows the quest to be shared with other players. 16 QUEST_FLAGS_NONE2 Unknown at this time and not used. 32 QUEST_FLAGS_EPIC Epic class quests (hunter) (??) 64 QUEST_FLAGS_RAID Raid or similiar player group needed for quest. 128 QUEST_FLAGS_TBC Added with or after TBC. 256 QUEST_FLAGS_UNK2 Quest needs extra non-objective items dropped (eg. ReqSourceID fields) (?) 512 QUEST_FLAGS_HIDDEN_REWARDS Item and monetary rewards are hidden in the initial quest details page and in the quest log but will appear once ready to be rewarded. 1024 QUEST_FLAGS_AUTO_REWARDED These quests are automatically rewarded on quest complete. 2048 QUEST_FLAGS_TBC_RACES Blood elf/draenei starting zone quests. 4096 QUEST_FLAGS_DAILY Daily repeatable quests (only flag that the core applies specific behavior for) 8192 QUEST_FLAGS_UNK5 Grizzly Hills PvP daily? Puts PvP-tag on? No idea.) Like all flag based fields, QuestFlags can be added for the different types of quest. SpecialFlags This field is a bitmask and controls only two extra requirements and has only 4 possible values. 0: No extra requirements 1: Makes the quest repeatable. 2: Makes the quest only completable by some external event (an entry in areatrigger_involvedrelation, , spell effect quest complete or an entry in spell_scripts with command 7 as some examples) 3: Both repeatable and completable only through an external event 4: Quest resets for player at beginning of month (must be combined with SpecialFlags 1 (repeatable)) CharTitleId The title the character will receive upon completion of the quest. See CharTitles.dbc PlayersSlain BonusTalents PrevQuestId If value > 0: Contains the previous quest id, that must be completed before this quest can be started. If value < 0: Contains the parent quest id, that must be active before this quest can be started. See the examples section for examples. NextQuestId If value > 0: Contains the next quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient. If value < 0: Contains the sub quest id, if PrevQuestId of that quest is not sufficient. If quest have many alternative next quests (class specific quests lead from single not class specific quest) field PrevQuestId in next quests can used for setting this dependence. See the examples section for examples. ExclusiveGroup If ExclusiveGroup > 0 Allows to define a group of quests of which only one may be chosen and completed. E.g. if from quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 only one should be allowed to be chosen, insert 1200 into ExclusiveGroup of all 3 quests. If ExclusiveGroup < 0 Allows to define a group of quests of which all must be completed and rewarded to start next quest. E.g. if quest 1000 dependent from one of quests 1200, 1201 and 1202 and all this quests have same negative exclusive group then all this quest must be completed and rewarded before quest 1000 can be started. See the examples section for examples. NextQuestInChain The quest entry from a creature or gameobject that ends a quest and starts a new one. The result is, that if you end the quest, the new quest instantly appears from the quest giver. See the examples section for examples. RewXPId The reward XP index for QuestXP.dbc. . That DBC file lists 9 different XP amounts (from 0 to 8) for each QuestLevel . This field selects the correct amount among them. As of 3.3.5a, the RewXPId index 0 means no XP for all QuestLevels. SrcItemId Item's ID given by the quest giver at beginning of the quest. Items will be deleted when quest is abandoned. SrcItemCount Amount of items given. SrcSpell Spell casted on player when quest is started. Can be a buff or a learning spell. Title Title of the quest. Details The quest text. You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: - line break, - name, - race, - class, :female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) Objectives Objectives of the quest. If empty, quest is an auto-complete quest that can be immediately finished without accepting it first. OfferRewardText First text send to the player by the NPC when completing the quest. You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: - line break, - name, - race, - class, :female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) RequestItemsText Text sent to player when the player tries to talk to the NPC with the quest active but incomplete. (The text under the \"Progress\" title in Wowhead.) You can use certain placeholders that will be filled in in-game: - line break, - name, - race, - class, :female; (male and female can be replace with any synonymn you want, but the order must stay the same. IE: boy:girl / man:woman / sir:madam / dude:chick) EndText Used only when SpecialFlags 2 is active. This is the objective text sent to the player describing the external event that is required to complete the quest. ObjectiveText Used to define non-standard objective texts, that show up in the questlog. Example, \"Heal fallen warrior\" and the number gets added by Count values. ReqItemId Item_template Id of required item to complete the quest. ReqItemCount Amount of required items ReqSourceID Item ID that is needed indirectly by the quest. For example, the quests asks for item X but the only way to get item X is by activating item Y; however, item Y is also a quest item. Therefore you set item Y's ID in this field. This requirement will not appear in the quest text, it is just for the core to know when to drop a quest item that isn't in the ReqItemID field but is still needed by the quest. ReqSourceCount The maximum number of copies of the item in ReqSourceID that can be picked up (and dropped by the core). Setting this value to 0 means the item stack size will be the maximum amount that is dropped by core. ReqCreatureOrGOId Value > 0: required creature_template ID the player needs to kill/cast on in order to complete the quest. Value < 0: required gameobject_template ID the player needs to cast on in order to complete the quest. If ReqSpellCast is != 0, the objective is to cast on target, else kill. NOTE: If ReqSpellCast is != 0 and the spell has effects Send Event or Quest Complete, this field may be left empty. ReqCreatureOrGOCount The number of times the creature or gameobject must be killed or casted upon. ReqSpellCast Spell ID of Spell that needs to be cast in order to fulfill a quest objective. A spell normally needs a target which is ReqCreatureOrGOId And for spells with \"SpellEffect with ImpliciteTargetA-B == 38\" check table Spell_script_target NOTE: If the spell has spell effects Send Event or Quest Complete, it can be entered here WITHOUT the need for a target and count. RewChoiceItemId, RewChoiceItemCount Id of item available for reward choice. Number of Charges in rewarded item available. RewItemId, RewItemCount Number of RewItem item Id given for reward (no choice). RewRepFaction, RewRepValue Faction Id (from Faction.dbc ) for which the quest give reputation points. Number of gain or lost reputation points for Faction at quest completion. This is special reputation rewarding. Normal reputation reward to quest rewarding creature faction calculated and added automatically. RewHonorableKills Number of honorable kill honor rewarded for completing this quest. Example: An example value is 15 for quest 8388: At level 70 an honorable kill is 20.9 honor worth. Multiply this with 15 and you receive 313.5, after the multiplication the value is rounded up. So the honor rewarded at level 70 is 314 for this quest. RewOrReqMoney Money earned by completing the quest (if value > 0). Money quest requirement (if value < 0). RewMoneyMaxLevel The money a character at level 80 would get when they complete this quest. This field also controls the XP given as the XP is calculated from the value in this field by the following formula. If the quest is repeatable, XP will be given only once. The total XP that a character will receive is also affected by the level difference between the character's level and the quest's level. The formula for calculating XP from the value in this field: QuestLevel >= 65: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 6.0 QuestLevel == 64: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 4.8 QuestLevel == 63: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 3.6 QuestLevel == 62: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 2.4 QuestLevel == 61: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 1.2 QuestLevel <= 60: XP = RewMoneyMaxLevel / 0.6 RewSpell Spell that is shown to be casted on quest completion in the quest log. Note that this spell will NOT be casted if RewSpellCast is non-zero. The spell in the other field will be casted instead, in which case the spell here only serves as the visual in the quest log. NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. RewSpellCast Spell that will always be casted at player when completing the quest. This can be learn spell and player learned some spell in result, or buff spell, for example. If this field is non-zero then this spell will ALWAYS be casted and the spell in RewSpell will not. NOTE: This field comes straight from the WDB and should not be changed. RewMailTemplateId If the quest gives as a reward an item from a possible list of items, the ID here corresponds to the proper loot template in mail_loot_template. . According to the rules in that loot template, items \"looted\" will be sent by mail at the completion of the quest. RewMailDelaySecs How many seconds to wait until the mail is sent to the character that turned in a quest rewarding items from a loot template defined in RewMailTemplateId PointMapId MapId of a quest point of interest (POI - Point Of Interest). POI will be shown on the map when quest is active. PointX X coordinate of quest POI. PointY Y coordinate of quest POI. PointOpt DetailsEmote Emote(s) played by the related NPC when you view the quest details before clicking the \"Accept\"-button. This is found in the SMSG_QUEST_GIVER_QUEST_DETAILS-packet in sniffs. DetailsEmoteDelay Delay from the last DetailsEmote before this one is played (in milliseconds) This is found in the SMSG_QUEST_GIVER_QUEST_DETAILS-packet in sniffs. IncompleteEmote Emote played by the related NPC when you view the quest details and one or more quest objective is not yet completed. CompleteEmote Emote played by the related NPC at the time all quest objects are completed. This is found in the SMSG_QUEST_GIVER_REQUEST_ITEMS-packet in sniffs. OfferRewardEmote Emote played by the NPC at the time the character is rewarded for the quest. This is found in the SMSG_QUEST_GIVER_OFFER_REWARD_MESSAGE-packet in sniffs. OfferRewardEmoteDelay Delay from the last OfferRewardEmote before this one is played (in milliseconds) This is found in the SMSG_QUEST_GIVER_OFFER_REWARD_MESSAGE-packet in sniffs. StartScript ID of the start script. See DBScripts.id CompleteScript ID of the end script.

X, Y, Z. 127 == 1.0, -127 == -1.0. This chunk has 13 bytes of unknown data at the end. The chunk size only covers the normals, though. MCLY Subchunk - Texture Layers Identifier Length MCLY 1-4 layers * 16 bytes These are texture layer definitions for this map chunk. 16 bytes per layer, up to 4 layers. Every texture layer other than the first will have an alpha map to specify blending amounts. The first layer is rendered with full opacity. To know which alphamap is used, there is an offset into the MCAL chunk. That one is relative to MCAL. You can animate these by setting the flags. Only simple linear animations are possible. You can specify the direction in 45\u00b0 steps and the speed. The textureId is just the array index of the filename array in the MTEX chunk. The effectId links to GroundEffectTexture.dbc. It defines the little detaildoodads as well as the footstep sounds and if footprints are visible. 00h uint32 textureId; 04h uint32 flags; 08h uint32 offsetInMCAL; 0Ch int32 effectId; // (actually int16 and padding) Flags Flag Description --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0x001 Animation: Rotate 45\u00b0 clockwise. 0x002 Animation: Rotate 90\u00b0 clockwise. 0x004 Animation: Rotate 180\u00b0 clockwise. 0x008 Animation: Make this faster. 0x010 Animation: Faster!! 0x020 Animation: Faster!!!! 0x040 Animation: Animate this texture as told in the other bits. 0x080 This will make the texture way brighter. Used for lava to make it \"glow\". 0x100 Use alpha map - set for every layer after the first 0x200 Alpha map is compressed MCRF Subchunk Identifier Length MCRF variable A uint32 list of with MCNK.nDoodadRefs + MCNK.nMapObjRefs indices into the file's MDDF and MODF chunks, saying which MCNK subchunk those particular doodads and objects are drawn within. This MCRF list contains duplicates for map doodads that overlap areas. As both, WMOs and M2s are referenced here, they get doodad indices first, then WMOs. If you have a doodad and a WMO in the ADT as well as the MCNK, you will have a {0,0} in MCRF with nDoodadRefs and MCNK.nMapObjRefs being 1. MCSH Subchunk - Shadows Identifier Length MCSH 512 bytes Shadow map for static shadows on the terrain. Can be left out with the chunk&1 flag not set. The shadow maps work as follows: the shadows are stored per bit as 0 or 1 (off or on) so we have 8 bytes (which equates to 64 values) X 64 bytes (64 values in this case) which ends up as a square 64x64 shadowmap with either white or black. Note that the shadow values come LSB first. MCAL Subchunk - Alpha maps Identifier Length MCAL 0-3 layers * 2048 bytes These are alpha maps for additional texture layers beside the base layer. Each layer contains a 64x64 alpha map. There are 2 alpha values per byte, first 4 bits and second 4 bits. Results in 2048 bytes per layer. MCLQ Subchunk - Liquids Identifier Length MCLQ ??? The size of the chunk is in the mapchunk header. The type of liquid is given in the mapchunk flags, also in the header. This information is old and incomplete as well as maybe wrong. The first two floats specify the minimum and maximum liquid height level. After them comes a 9x9 height map for the water with the following format per vertex: 0x00 int16 ? 0x02 int16 ? 0x04 float height value The unknown int values might be color or transparency info, or something entirely different... Most frequently they are 0. Followed by 8x8 bytes of flags for every liquid \"tile\" between the 9x9 vertex grid. The value 0x0F means do not render. (the specific flag for this seems to be 8 but I'm not sure - but it fixes some places where there was extra \"water\" sticking into the rest of the scenery) Finally, 0x54 bytes of additional data, no idea what it's used for. MCSE Subchunk - Sound emitters Identifier Length MCSE ??? This is not well understood.

The first byte of the array is for pixels 0 through 7, the second byte for pixels 8 through 15 and so on. Bit 0 of each byte corresponds to the first pixel (leftmost) in the group, bit 7 to the rightmost. A set bit indicates the pixel is opaque while a zero bit indicates a transparent pixel.

From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXTn DXT1 DXT1 (also known as Block Compression 1 or BC1) is the smallest variation of S3TC, storing 16 input pixels in 64 bits of output, consisting of two 16-bit RGB 5:6:5 color values and a 4x4 two bit lookup table. If the first color value (c 0 ) is numerically greater than the second color value (c 1 ), then two other colors are calculated, such that c 2 = 2/3 c 0 + 1/3 c 1 and c 3 = 1/3 c 0 + 2/3 c 1 Otherwise, if c 0 <= c 1 , then c 2 = 1/2 c 0 + 1/2 c 1 and c 3 is transparent black corresponding to a premultiplied alpha format. The lookup table is then consulted to determine the color value for each pixel, with a value of 0 corresponding to c 0 and a value of 3 corresponding to c 3 . DXT1 does not store alpha data enabling higher compression ratios. DXT3 DXT3 (also known as Block Compression 2 or BC2) converts 16 input pixels (corresponding to a 4x4 pixel block) into 128 bits of output, consisting of 64 bits of alpha channel data (4 bits for each pixel) followed by 64 bits of color data, encoded the same way as DXT1 (with the exception that the 4 color version of the DXT1 algorithm is always used instead of deciding which version to use based on the relative values of c 0 and c 1 ). In DXT3, the color data is interpreted as not having been premultiplied by alpha. Typically DXT2/3 are well suited to images with sharp alpha transitions, between translucent and opaque areas. DXT5 DXT5 (also known as Block Compression 3 or BC3) converts 16 input pixels into 128 bits of output, consisting of 64 bits of alpha channel data (two 8 bit alpha values and a 4x4 3 bit lookup table) followed by 64 bits of color data (encoded the same way as DXT2 and DXT3).

The format's capabilities include compression, encryption, file segmentation, extensible file metadata, cryptographic signature and the ability to store multiple versions of the same file for internationalization and platform-specific differences. MPQ archives can use a variety of compression algorithms which may also be combined. The definitive source for information on MPQ Files is http://wiki.devklog.net/index.php?title=The_MoPaQ_Archive_Format . The following summary only includes facts relevant for 1.12.X Client versions Technical overview All numbers in the MPQ format are in little endian byte order; signed numbers use the two's complement system. Data types are listed either as int (integer, the number of bits specified), byte (8 bits), or char (bytes which contain ASCII characters). All sizes and offsets are in bytes, unless specified otherwise. Structure members are listed in the following general form: offset from the beginning of the structure: data type(array size) member name : member description General Archive Layout The physical layout of the files looks like this Archive Header File Data Hash Table Block Table In the following the components are discussed in the logical order of processing required to read and extract files from MPQ Archives Archive Header Header size is 32 bytes, maximum archive size is 4 GB. 00h: char(4) Magic Indicates that the file is a MPQ archive. Must be ASCII \"MPQ\" 1Ah. 04h: int32 HeaderSize Size of the archive header. 08h: int32 ArchiveSize Size of the whole archive, including the header. 0Ch: int16 FormatVersion MPQ format version. 0000h for Classic WoW. 0Eh: int8 SectorSizeShift Power of two exponent specifying the number of 512-byte disk sectors in each logical sector in the archive. The size of each logical sector in the archive is 512 * 2^SectorSizeShift. Bugs in the Storm library dictate that this should always be 3 (4096 byte sectors). 10h: int32 HashTableOffset Offset to the beginning of the hash table, relative to the beginning of the archive. 14h: int32 BlockTableOffset Offset to the beginning of the block table, relative to the beginning of the archive. 18h: int32 HashTableEntries Number of entries in the hash table. Must be a power of two, and must be less than 2^16 1Ch: int32 BlockTableEntries Number of entries in the block table. Hash Table The Hash Table serves as a quick means of filename lookup without having to go through string comparisons. For each file in the archive, the full path is hashed using a proprietary algorithm (for source see http://wiki.devklog.net/index.php?title=The_MoPaQ_Archive_Format#Algorithm_Source_Code ) resulting in three 32bit integers. The first of those hashes serves as primary lookup key for the Hash Table, the others are used for verification in case of a hash collision. In the case that two files have the same lookup key (hash collision), the first file is stored under that hash, and the second file is stored under the next free hash. So during lookup, if the second and third hash don't match, the algorithm goes down the list until it either finds a match of an empty entry. Each entry in the Hash Table looks like this: 00h: int32 FilePathHashA The hash of the file path, using method A. 04h: int32 FilePathHashB The hash of the file path, using method B. 08h: int16 Language The language of the file. This is a Windows LANGID data type, and uses the same values. 0 indicates the default language (American English), or that the file is language-neutral. 0Ah: int8 Platform The platform the file is used for. 0 indicates the default platform. No other values have been observed. 0Ch: int32 FileBlockIndex If the hash table entry is valid, this is the index into the block table of the file. Otherwise, one of the following two values: FFFFFFFFh Hash table entry is empty, and has always been empty. Terminates searches for a given file. FFFFFFFEh Hash table entry is empty, but was valid at some point (in other words, the file was deleted). Does not terminate searches for a given file The Hash Table is encrypted using a proprietary encryption algorithm using \"(hash table)\" as key. The encryption algorithm is also documented at http://wiki.devklog.net/index.php?title=The_MoPaQ_Archive_Format#Algorithm_Source_Code Block Table The Block Table contains offsets into the File Data block for each File in the Archive. It also stores file attributes like compression or encryption. Hash Table FileBlockIndex points to entries in the Block Table. Like the Hash Table it is encrypted, using \"(block table)\" as key. Each Block Table entry looks like this: 00h: int32 BlockOffset Offset of the beginning of the block, relative to the beginning of the archive. 04h: int32 BlockSize Size of the block in the archive. 08h: int32 FileSize Size of the file data stored in the block. If the file is compressed, this is the size of the uncompressed file data. 0Ch: int32 Flags Bit mask of the flags for the block. Known flags are: Flag name Value Meaning MPQ_FILE_IMPLODE 0x00000100 File is compressed using PKWARE Data compression library MPQ_FILE_COMPRESS 0x00000200 File is compressed using combination of compression methods MPQ_FILE_ENCRYPTED 0x00010000 The file is encrypted MPQ_FILE_FIX_KEY 0x00020000 The decryption key for the file is altered according to the position of the file in the archive MPQ_FILE_PATCH_FILE 0x00100000 The file contains incremental patch for an existing file in base MPQ MPQ_FILE_SINGLE_UNIT 0x01000000 Instead of being divided to 0x1000-bytes blocks, the file is stored as single unit MPQ_FILE_DELETE_MARKER 0x02000000 File is a deletion marker, indicating that the file no longer exists. This is used to allow patch archives to delete files present in lower-priority archives in the search chain. The file usually has length of 0 or 1 byte and its name is a hash MPQ_FILE_SECTOR_CRC 0x04000000 File has checksums for each sector (explained in the File Data section). Ignored if file is not compressed or imploded. MPQ_FILE_EXISTS 0x80000000 Set if file exists, reset when the file was deleted File Data Block Table BlockOffset points to the beginning of a file data block. Each file data block has a header of nSectors+1 int32 values, indicating offsets to each sector start (relative to the beginning of the file data block). The final value of this list is the total (compressed) file size, including the header. The size of each block can easily be calculated from the difference between two offsets. If the block is compressed, the first byte of every sector indicates the compression method used Extracting a file This is a step-by-step instruction. Read the File Header, find the offsets to the Hash Table and Block Table Read and Decrypt Hash Table and Block Table Compute Hashes for the file (Full Path, all Slashes converted to Backslashes) => Hash0, Hash1, Hash2 HashTableOffset = Hash0 & ( Header.HashTableEntries -1) Starting from HashTableOffset , go through the Hash Table and compare Hash1 and Hash2 to HashTable.FilePathHashA and HashTable.FilePathHashB respectively until either a match or an empty entry is found. In the latter case the file you are looking for does not exist. Find the Block Table entry which corresponds to HashTable.FileBlockIndex Go to the file offset specified in BlockTable.BlockOffset Read int32 values until you reach a value that is equal to BlockTable.BlockSize => SectorOffset[0] ... SectorOffset[n] For every entry of SectorOffset[0]...SectorOffset[n-1] , seek to BlockTable.BlockOffset+SectorOffset[x] Read SectorOffset[x+1]-SectorOffset[x] bytes of data. If BlockTable.Flags has a compressed flag set, the first byte of each sector indicates the compression method applied. Decrypt and or decompress each sector as necessary, stitch them together, et voila, there is your file The Listfile Each MPQ in WoW 1.12.X contains a \"(listfile)\".

The file usually has length of 0 or 1 byte and its name is a hash MPQ_FILE_SECTOR_CRC 0x04000000 File has checksums for each sector (explained in the File Data section).

A faction entry from this dbc contains all of the needed data to calculate hostility, friendliness, or neutrality to any other faction in this dbc. IMPORTANT: These values are only used for the creature_template and gameobject_template tables. Structure Field Nb Name Type 1 ID Int 2 Name (Ref to Faction.dbc ) Int 4 ourMask Bitmask (4 bits) 5 friendlyMask Bitmask (4 bits) 6 hostileMask Bitmask (4 bits) 7-10 enemyFactions Int 11-14 friendFactions Int Explanations & Calculations Each different entry has different relations towards any other faction. The easiest calculation when calculating hostility or friendliness is to look at the Friend factions and Enemy factions columns in the table below. If our faction has the other faction's ID in the Enemy factions list, then it is hostile to that faction (at least). The same thing applies for a friendliness check on the Friend factions column. If our faction doesn't have the other faction's ID in the enemy or friend faction list, then we'll have to get more complicated in calculating hostility or friendliness. First, let's define the four faction groups: ID Bit Name 0 1 All players (and pets) 1 2 Alliance players (and their pets) 2 4 Horde players (and their pets) 3 8 Monster (Not a player nor a pet) The first mask (ourMask) defines what type of faction we are dealing with. Eg, faction 1 (PLAYER, Human) has 3 as ourMask; that means that it has the first two bits set so it classifies as both 'All players' and 'Alliance players'. The second mask (friendlyMask) defines what faction groups this faction is friendly with. That means that if this field contains the bit for a faction group, then it is friendly with that faction. Eg, faction 5 (PLAYER, Undead) has 4 as friendlyMask; that means that it has the third bit set so it is friendly with 'Horde players'. The third mask (hostileMask) defines what faction groups this faction is hostile with. This faction will be hostile to any faction group whose bit is set in this field. For example, let's examine the first two Stormwind factions. The first one (faction 11) has hostileMask 12. The binary representation of this is 1100, with the third and fourth bits set. The second Stormwind faction (faction 12) has hostileMask 4. The binary representation of this is 0100, with the third bit set. Applying the formulas to these two values, we can see that faction 11 is hostile to Horde players and also anything that is not a player while faction 12 is only hostile to Horde players. Faction 12 will not aggro any creature that is part of the monster faction group. For the mathematically inclined, the basic formula to test for friendliness is (friendlyMask & other.ourMask) != 0 ...where other is another faction. The same thing applies for hostility: (hostileMask & other.ourMask) != 0 For the not so mathematically inclined, we'll have to compare two binary numbers. First, you will need to convert all of the masks to binary form with four digits; so 1 becomes 0001, 2 becomes 0010, 3 becomes 0011, etc. Second, line up the friendlyMask or hostileMask value with the ourMask value. For example: 1100 //hostileMask of faction 11 1000 //ourMask of faction 14 Next, compare the two numbers, the bottom one with the one on top and follow these rules: 1 and 1 is 1 1 and 0 is 0 0 and 1 is 0 0 and 0 is 0 So, continuing our example: 1100 1000 ---- 1000 Finally, check the result that you get with the value 0. Only 0000 will equal 0, anything else will not equal 0. If the result 'does not ' equal 0, then the faction is hostile/friendly to the other faction. In our example, it is obvious that we do not have 0 (we have 8 in fact if you convert to base 10 again), so faction 11 is hostile to faction 14 and will aggro it. From all of the above calculations, we notice that if ourMask for a faction is 0 (that means 0000), it will be neutral to everything (not necessarily friendly). If the friendlyMask for a faction is 0, then it will never be friendly to anything or anyone (unless it has other faction IDs in the Friend factions column in the table below). Finally, if the hostileMask for a faction is 0, it will never be hostile to anything or anyone (again there may be exceptions in the Enemy factions column in the table below). To summarize, you should follow these steps to calculate if faction A is hostile to faction B: Look for faction B in the Enemy faction list of faction A in the table below * If found, then faction A is hostile to faction B and you can stop * If not found, then continue with the next steps Look up hostileMask for faction A in table below Look up ourMask for faction B in table below Do the and (&) operation on the two values * If the result is 0, then faction A is not hostile to faction B (but not necessarily friendly either) * If the result is not 0, then faction A IS hostile to faction B And these steps to calculate if faction A is friendly to faction B: Look for faction B in the Friend faction list of faction A in the table below * If found, then faction A is friendly to faction B and you can stop * If not found, then continue with the next steps Look up friendlyMask for faction A in table below Look up ourMask for faction B in table below Do the and (&) operation on the two values * If the result is 0, then faction A is not friendly to faction B (but not necessarily hostile either) * If the result is not 0, then faction A IS friendly to faction B Content Version is : 3.3.5a ID Name ourMask friendlyMask hostileMask Enemy Factions Friend Factions 1 PLAYER, Human 3 2 12 2 PLAYER, Orc 5 4 10 3 PLAYER, Dwarf 3 2 12 4 PLAYER, Night Elf 3 2 12 5 PLAYER, Undead 5 4 10 6 PLAYER, Tauren 5 4 10 7 Creature 0 0 0 10 Escortee 3 2 0 11 Stormwind 3 2 12 12 Stormwind 2 2 4 72 14 Monster 8 0 1 15 Creature 0 0 0 7 16 Monster 8 0 1 14 17 Defias Brotherhood 8 0 1 15 18 Murloc 8 0 1 19 19 Gnoll -

The easiest calculation when calculating hostility or friendliness is to look at the Friend factions and Enemy factions columns in the table below. If our faction has the other faction's ID in the Enemy factions list, then it is hostile to that faction (at least). The same thing applies for a friendliness check on the Friend factions column. If our faction doesn't have the other faction's ID in the enemy or friend faction list, then we'll have to get more complicated in calculating hostility or friendliness. First, let's define the four faction groups: ID Bit Name 0 1 All players (and pets) 1 2 Alliance players (and their pets) 2 4 Horde players (and their pets) 3 8 Monster (Not a player nor a pet) The first mask (ourMask) defines what type of faction we are dealing with. Eg, faction 1 (PLAYER, Human) has 3 as ourMask; that means that it has the first two bits set so it classifies as both 'All players' and 'Alliance players'. The second mask (friendlyMask) defines what faction groups this faction is friendly with. That means that if this field contains the bit for a faction group, then it is friendly with that faction. Eg, faction 5 (PLAYER, Undead) has 4 as friendlyMask; that means that it has the third bit set so it is friendly with 'Horde players'. The third mask (hostileMask) defines what faction groups this faction is hostile with. This faction will be hostile to any faction group whose bit is set in this field. For example, let's examine the first two Stormwind factions. The first one (faction 11) has hostileMask 12. The binary representation of this is 1100, with the third and fourth bits set. The second Stormwind faction (faction 12) has hostileMask 4. The binary representation of this is 0100, with the third bit set. Applying the formulas to these two values, we can see that faction 11 is hostile to Horde players and also anything that is not a player while faction 12 is only hostile to Horde players. Faction 12 will not aggro any creature that is part of the monster faction group. For the mathematically inclined, the basic formula to test for friendliness is (friendlyMask & other.ourMask) != 0 ...where other is another faction. The same thing applies for hostility: (hostileMask & other.ourMask) != 0 For the not so mathematically inclined, we'll have to compare two binary numbers. First, you will need to convert all of the masks to binary form with four digits; so 1 becomes 0001, 2 becomes 0010, 3 becomes 0011, etc. Second, line up the friendlyMask or hostileMask value with the ourMask value. For example: 1100 //hostileMask of faction 11 1000 //ourMask of faction 14 Next, compare the two numbers, the bottom one with the one on top and follow these rules: 1 and 1 is 1 1 and 0 is 0 0 and 1 is 0 0 and 0 is 0 So, continuing our example: 1100 1000 ---- 1000 Finally, check the result that you get with the value 0. Only 0000 will equal 0, anything else will not equal 0. If the result 'does not ' equal 0, then the faction is hostile/friendly to the other faction. In our example, it is obvious that we do not have 0 (we have 8 in fact if you convert to base 10 again), so faction 11 is hostile to faction 14 and will aggro it. From all of the above calculations, we notice that if ourMask for a faction is 0 (that means 0000), it will be neutral to everything (not necessarily friendly). If the friendlyMask for a faction is 0, then it will never be friendly to anything or anyone (unless it has other faction IDs in the Friend factions column in the table below). Finally, if the hostileMask for a faction is 0, it will never be hostile to anything or anyone (again there may be exceptions in the Enemy factions column in the table below). To summarize, you should follow these steps to calculate if faction A is hostile to faction B: Look for faction B in the Enemy faction list of faction A in the table below","title":"Explanations &amp; Calculations"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#42-if-found-then-faction-a-is-hostile-to-faction-b-and-you-can-stop","text":"","title":"* If found, then faction A is hostile to faction B and you can stop"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#42-if-not-found-then-continue-with-the-next-steps","text":"Look up hostileMask for faction A in table below Look up ourMask for faction B in table below Do the and (&) operation on the two values","title":"* If not found, then continue with the next steps"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#42-if-the-result-is-0-then-faction-a-is-not-hostile-to-faction-b-but-not-necessarily-friendly-either","text":"","title":"* If the result is 0, then faction A is not hostile to faction B (but not necessarily friendly either)"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#42-if-the-result-is-not-0-then-faction-a-is-hostile-to-faction-b","text":"And these steps to calculate if faction A is friendly to faction B: Look for faction B in the Friend faction list of faction A in the table below","title":"* If the result is not 0, then faction A IS hostile to faction B"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#42-if-found-then-faction-a-is-friendly-to-faction-b-and-you-can-stop","text":"","title":"* If found, then faction A is friendly to faction B and you can stop"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#42-if-not-found-then-continue-with-the-next-steps_1","text":"Look up friendlyMask for faction A in table below Look up ourMask for faction B in table below Do the and (&) operation on the two values","title":"* If not found, then continue with the next steps"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#42-if-the-result-is-0-then-faction-a-is-not-friendly-to-faction-b-but-not-necessarily-hostile-either","text":"","title":"* If the result is 0, then faction A is not friendly to faction B (but not necessarily hostile either)"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#42-if-the-result-is-not-0-then-faction-a-is-friendly-to-faction-b","text":"","title":"* If the result is not 0, then faction A IS friendly to faction B"},{"location":"File-Formats/Client/DBC_structure/FactionTemplate.dbc/#content","text":"Version is : 3.3.5a ID Name ourMask friendlyMask hostileMask Enemy Factions Friend Factions 1 PLAYER, Human 3 2 12 2 PLAYER, Orc 5 4 10 3 PLAYER, Dwarf 3 2 12 4 PLAYER, Night Elf 3 2 12 5 PLAYER, Undead 5 4 10 6 PLAYER, Tauren 5 4 10 7 Creature 0 0 0 10 Escortee 3 2 0 11 Stormwind 3 2 12 12 Stormwind 2 2 4 72 14 Monster 8 0 1 15 Creature 0 0 0 7 16 Monster 8 0 1 14 17 Defias Brotherhood 8 0 1 15 18 Murloc 8 0 1 19 19 Gnoll -

Each Spell has up to three effects, which have generic behaviour, determined by values in spell.dbc and then custom behaviour, that is scripted either using C++ or dbscripts_on_spell (this is restricted to DUMMY, SCRIPT_EFFECT spell effects). Spell script can be anything ranging from triggering additional spells under certain conditions, to restricting targets of given spell. Spell.dbc - is the source of spell definitions. Tells us what effects/values/targets etc a given spell has. Description of Spell.dbc Triggered spells - There are 3 main kinds of triggered spells: 1. Event/AI triggered 2. Triggered by another spell (arcane missiles) 3. Triggered by aura (Talents/Blizzard) Triggered spell setting influences many aspects of given spell. It skips cast time, cooldown checking, can target unselectable targets and more. Also these three kinds heavily influence PROCs, meaning in case of wrong usage, spells tend to not proc properly among other things (namely skipping safety checks).

Of course they better have the cash and know the location your going to! Pets Hunters will automatically feed their pets and keep them happy. Socialize Bots will respond to you in tells, and other chat, as you interact with them. Gameobject interaction with bots: The bot(s) can interact with gameobjects. This is particularly useful, in order to complete 'gather' type quests (e.g Milly's harvest in Northshire). The bot(s) can also harvest 'ore deposits' and 'herbs' Four commands have been introduced 'collect', 'survey, 'find' & 'get', to facilitate this feature. The 'collect' command provides a way to have a bot automatically get loot or objects in the world. The command by itself gives you a display of what settings the bots have. Defaults are stored in the playerbot.conf. The subcommands do the actual work: combat - bot will loot after combat for the options that are set loot - bot will grab all loot available from corpse quest - bot will grab all quest items on corpse profession - bot will grab any profession related item that the bot has from corpse skin - if you have skinning, and corpse has been looted, bot will skin corpse. Most of the time you may want this option and the loot option enabled, but if you are grabbing the stuff as you are going around, the bot will skin afterwards. objects - bot will collect things that are specified by the survey and get commands distance: - bot will loot objects in the specified distance value none - removes any collect options that have been set The 'survey' command provides the means for bot(s) to detect gameobjects in the world. It can be used to detect available gameobjects local to a single bot, or more effectively (wider area) those for a party of bots. Suggestion: setup the 'survey' command as an assigned macro button, on the client (e.g /p survey). You can then quickly refresh the gameobject list. Gameobject list [GAMEOBJECT LINK] (Currently bots can only interact with ore, herb and needed quest items) [Copper Vein][Silverleaf][Earthroot][Milly's Harvest][Battered Chest][Food Crate] Then, use the 'find' or 'get' commands to interect with the gameobject. Using the gameobject list information, it is possible to locate and/or fetch each of the gameobjects. To select a [GAMEOBJECT LINK], hold down the shift key and click on the relevant link with your mouse. Creature interaction with bots: The bot(s) can now interact directly with creatures. This will enable bot(s) to independently contact NPCs, without the need for player's selection. This opens up new possiblities for bot/NPC commerce. Each bot will maintain it's own item list (m_itemIds - This is a list of paired data). The first component (UNIT_NPC_FLAG) dictates what is to done with the second component (itemid). Each bot will also maintain it's own active auction list (m_auctions - This is a list of paired data). The first component (ActionFlags) dictates the action to be performed on the second component (auctionid). While(m_itemIds not empty) { bot will scan for surrounding creatures (findNearbyCreature()) who can service m_itemIds if(found) Search is carried out for all itemids that can be processed by this creature. if(processed successfully) This instance of the data pair (npcflag,itemid) will be removed from m_itemIds While(m_auctions not empty) process contained auctionids according to ActionFlag & then update m_auctions } Please note that bot(s) m_itemIds & m_auctions will be emptied, when bot(s) are dismissed. Repair with bots: Bot can now repair items - equipped or in bags. If the bot is a member of a guild, then the guild fund is used for repairs. If not, the bots own gold supply is used. If the bot cannot pay for the repair, they remain damaged. The new 'stats' command provides useful information to help in the repair decision. First: Money available to bot(s) Second: Free inventory slots for bot(s) Third: Estimated (excludes NPC reputation discount) item damage cost for bot(s). Trading with bots: To trade items/money with your bot simply initiate a trade and the bot will tell you how much money and items are available. To request an item simple whisper the bot and shift click the link of the item you would like. You can link multiple items on the same line. You can also request money in the following manner when the trade window is open: /w BOTNAME 10g <-- request that the bot give you 10 gold /w BOTNAME 6g500s25c <-- request 6 gold, 500 silver, and 25 copper A bot is also able to show an item in its 'Will not be traded' slot.

The most common option on Mac OS X 10.6 is to install Xcode 3.2 (3.2.6 is the most recent version). This version comes with several compilers (Apple GCC 4.0, Apple GCC 4.2, Apple LLVM/clang), but none of them is able to compile C++11 code. It is possible to get a more recent compiler on Mac OS X 10.6 by installing the Snow Leopard build of Xcode 4.2. Sadly, this version is only available for paying developer accounts. But more importantly, this version only has partial C++11 support, which is not good enough. In summary: the Xcode versions that support Mac OS X 10.6 do not provide a modern C++ compiler that is able to compile the C++11 source code of the CMaNGOS project. Building GCC on Mac OS X Therefore, we suggest to install a recent versions of GCC (this guide uses GCC 4.8.5). This toolchain can be installed next to an existing Xcode installation, so you can continue to use Xcode as before, while the new GCC can be used to build the CMaNGOS sources. You will need about 3 GB of free disk space for the entire process. Once installed, you can remove the temporary files and reclaim most of this disk space again. We're assuming that you have a working Xcode 3.2 installation, with the command line tools installed. Open the Terminal application, and follow the steps below to install GCC 4.8.5. 1. Create a temporary directory for GCC's sources and build. $ mkdir ~/src && cd ~/src 2. Download the GCC 4.8.5 sources. $ curl -o gcc-4.8.5.tar.bz2 https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.8.5/gcc-4.8.5.tar.bz2 3. Download and verify the source's signature [optional] It's rather unlikely, but if you know you have gpg installed, you can download the relevant signatures to verify the integrity of the GCC source tarball. If you trust the download from the previous step, feel free to skip this step. $ curl -o gcc-4.8.5.tar.bz2.sig https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.8.5/gcc-4.8.5.tar.bz2.sig $ curl -o gnu-keyring.gpg https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg $ gpg --verify --no-default-keyring --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg gcc-4.8.5.tar.bz2.sig 4. Extract the sources. $ tar xvjf gcc-4.8.5.tar.bz2 5. Download additional requirements for GCC. GCC requires some additional packages to build, so we'll make sure these are available in GCC's source tree. Note that different GCC versions might require different versions of these packages, so if you're building a different version of GCC than 4.8.5, please check its requirements and adjust the commands below as needed. $ cd gcc-4.8.5 $ for prereq in mpfr-2.4.2 gmp-4.3.2; do curl -o $prereq.tar.bz2 ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/$prereq.tar.bz2 && tar xjf $prereq.tar.bz2 && ln -sf $prereq ${prereq%%[^a-z]*}; done $ for prereq in mpc-0.8.1; do curl -o $prereq.tar.gz ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/$prereq.tar.gz && tar xzf $prereq.tar.gz && ln -sf $prereq ${prereq%%[^a-z]*}; done $ cd .. 6. Create a build directory for GCC next to its source tree. $ mkdir gcc-4.8.5-build && cd gcc-4.8.5-build 7. Run GCC's configure step. We're assuming that you have Xcode 3.2 installed in /Applications. Please verify that the path to Xcode's SDKs directory is correct! We're also telling the configure step to install GCC in a directory 'toolchains/gcc-4.8.5'. If you prefer to install GCC in a different folder, this is the time to change it. $ ../gcc-4.8.5/configure --prefix=$HOME/toolchains/gcc-4.8.5 --enable-languages=c,c++ --with-sysroot=/Applications/Xcode/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk 8. Build GCC. Assuming the previous step was successful, build GCC now. This might take a while. $ make 9. Install GCC. $ make install Finishing If all commands were successful, you now have a C++11 compiler capable of building CMaNGOS on your system! Now is a good time to do a quick test and verify that you can actually run it (change the path accordingly if you've changed the installation folder in step 7): $ ~/toolchains/gcc-4.8.5/bin/g++ --version If GCC prints its version, you can clean up the temporary files and folders if you want, by deleting the 'src' folder in your home folder.","title":"Motivation"},{"location":"Useful/Getting-a-C--11-compiler-on-Mac-OS-X/#motivation","text":"Development on Mac OS X is mostly done with the Developer Tools provided by Apple (Xcode).

Keep in mind, that MinGW toolchains have enthusiast and DIY meaning to them, many distributions are highly customized, so its nearly impossible to answer every possible question or solve every possible issue you may have with a particular distribution. This page is intended to only provide a kickstart for your own journey. Reasons to consider using MinGW instead of MSVC++ MinGW toolchains are ports of GCC for Windows. GCC can offer a number of advantages over MSVC++ even on Windows, which include, but not limited to: Open source and licensing policy. More details at http://mingw.org/license GCC tends to implement newer C++ standards and drafts much faster than MSVC++. It was brought to light in the early 2010s, with Visual C++ often lagging years behind with C++11 features, MinGW gained a large following as a result of that. It offers a much higher customizability in terms of build options than MSVC++. An expert with a fresh GCC version can try to take advantages of new architectures like AMD's Zen by rebuilding the program and it's dependencies with new instruction sets. Choosing a MinGW toolchain variant for your needs Threading model The first and foremost quality of a MinGW toolchain distribution. POSIX threading model Implements C++11 threads by default through a dependency POSIX compatibility layer (such as WinPthread). A fail-safe variant for cross-platfrom development. However, most pre-built POSIX distributions include only dynamic Libwinpthreads library (a DLL), so if you aim for a fully static self-contained build, this may not fit your needs, as you have to carry at least one or two DLLs (Libwinpthreads and Libgcc) from the distribution alongside resulting binaries. WIN32 threading model In the recent past, these variants did not include C++11 threads by default, therefore were unfit for cross-platform development. Newer versions from some toolchain builders started to include C++11 threads support through alternative implementations, such as a win32 port of pthreads or mingw-std-threads. You should carefully study contents of such distributions to make sure its equipped with std::thread support. Exception Handling Second most important quality, deciding whether its fit for development and debugging or release builds. DWARF (Debugging With Attributed Record Formats) Architecture: 32bit target toolchains only. Speed: Fastest for 32 bit, nearly zero overhead, directly competes with MSVC++. Compatibility: Worst among all listed. Compatible only with other DWARF binaries. May introduce errors with linking and debugging, therefore generally unfit for development. Origin: Unix ELF binaries standard, an alien species to Windows ecosystem. Usage recommendation: Release builds distribution only, unfit for debugging and development due to compatibility issues. SJLJ (SetJmp / LongJmp) Architecture: 32bit and 64bit target toolchains. Speed: Slowest among all listed, introduces constant fixed penalty to produced binaries. Compatibility: Best compatibility among all listed. Safely binds together DLLs, allows handling exceptions outside of code built with MinGW all the way up to system libraries. Origin: Cross-platform standards. Usage recommendation: Best option for development and debugging for 32bit builds. A fail safe option for 64bit development and debugging due to compatibility. Not recommended for any release builds due to speed penalty. SEH (Structured Exception Handling) Architecture: 64bit target toolchains only. Speed: Fastest for 64bit, directly competes with MSVC++. Compatibility: Very good, compatible with MSVC++ symbol mangling. Origin: A variety of standards. 32bit SEH option for MinGW is not available due to patent issues. Usage recommendation: Best option overall for 64bit for all purposes due to balance of speed and compatibility. MinGW Distribution Once you've decided which is the variant you want, all thats left to do is pick your MinGW distribution. At the time of the writing, the most frequently updated distribution project is MinGW-w64, which seems to be recognized as the distribution of choice for many major projects (such as popular Linux distributions and Qt). Distributions from MinGW team and TDM-GCC are less frequently updated. If you are cross-compiling on Linux, you should probably stick to versions found in your package manager, so you can ask maintainers for support if any issue arises. Some popular IDE software with C++ and MinGW support Code::Blocks (cross-platform, open source) QtCreator (cross-platform, open source) Eclipse (cross-platform, open source) CLion (cross-platform, commercial) Quickstart: Building Boost library for use with your MinGW toolchain on Windows In this example we will use Boost 1.64.0. Unzip downloaded Windows boost sources (\u201cboost_1_64_0.zip\u201d in our case) to a folder of choice. Open Command Line (cmd.exe), navigate to the root folder of the extracted boost source (it must have file \u201cbootstrap.bat\u201d in it). Add the \u201cbin\u201d folder of your MinGW toolchain to your PATH environment, example: set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\MinGW\\bin Configure boost for GCC with the following command: start /b /wait bootstrap.bat gcc Once configuration is complete, let's build a static Boost library into a fresh clean folder, let's say \u201cC:\\Boost\u201d: start /b /wait b2 install --prefix=\u201cC:\\Boost\u201d --build-type=complete toolset=gcc variant=release link=static threading=multi runtime-link=static After build is successfully done, you need to add it to your MinGW: Move \u201cboost\u201d directory from \u201cC:\\Boost\\include\\boost-1_64\u201d into \u201cinclude\u201d subdirectory of your MinGW toolchain; Move all library files (*.a) from \u201cC:\\Boost\\lib\u201d into \u201clib\u201d subdirectory of your MinGW toolchain. Done. Your MinGW toolchain now contains a ready-to-use Boost library.
