## The `creature_movement` table
***

This table holds information on each unique creature (guid) waypoint.  In essence, a waypoint just defines a path that the creature will follow by going from point to point. More specifically, once the creature arrives at a point, it can do different things like cast a spell, do an emote, etc. Usually this table is filled through the .wp command (and its various subcommands) in the world.

Please note that for a creature to use waypoints, its MovementType must be 2. Movetype must also be set to "way"

To add waypoints in-game:
- .npc setmovetype way<creature guid or select npc
- .wp add guid or select npc

### Description of the fields

#### id
The guid of the creature if creature_movement. See [creature_guid](https://github.com/cmangos/issues/wiki/creature)

#### point

Defines the waypoint number. A creature will go from waypoint to waypoint in the order controlled by this field.

#### position&#95;x

The X position of the waypoint.

#### position&#95;y

The Y position of the waypoint.

#### position&#95;z

The Z position of the waypoint.

#### waittime

The time that the creature will wait before heading to the next waypoint, in milliseconds.

#### script&#95;id

Reference to [DBScripts_on_creature_movement](https://github.com/cmangos/issues/wiki/DBScripts_on_creature_movement)

#### orientation

The orientation the creature will face once it reaches the waypoint. 
(North = 0.0; South = pi (3.14159))


Setting this field to 100 means the creature will not change its orientation upon reaching the waypoint.
