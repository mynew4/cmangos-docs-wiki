## Introduction

ADT Files contain the actual terrain information (height maps, texturing, WMOs, doodads, etc) required by the client to render the static parts of the terrain. They use a [[chunked file structure]] like [[WDT Files]]. Each ADT File contains 256 (16x16) map tiles (or map chunks).
Each map tile is 33.3333 yards on each side, making the size of the map block in an ADT file 533.3333 yards on each side in total. As every WDT File can reference 64x64 ADT map blocks, the whole map is approximately 34133.33 yards on each side.

## Chunks

### MVER - Version

| Identifier | Length  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| MVER       | 4 bytes |

This chunk specifies the format version. All ADT Files in 1.12.X have Version 18.
***
### MHDR - Header

| Identifier | Length   |
| ---------- | -------- |
| MHDR       | 64 bytes |

The Header chunk contains offsets to various other chunks. All offsets are relative to the start of the MHDR data block

```
00h      uint32          flags;     //Known Values: 1 = contains MFBO
04h      uint32          offsMCIN;

This is a lookup table containing absolute offsets and sizes for every map tile in the file. There are 16x16 = 256 entries of 16 bytes each:

```
00h    uint32 offsMCNK            // absolute offset.
04h    uint32 size                // the size of the MCNK chunk, this is refering to.

### MCNK - Map Chunk Data

| Identifier | Length                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| MCNK       | 128 byte header + variable data |

After the general information above 256 MCNK chunks follow. Each of these has a header followed by subchunks. Subchunks mostly behave like normal file chunks, except for some flakyness in their chunk size values. The header looks like this:

```
00h      uint32          flags;                             // 1h=has MCSH, 2h=impassible, 4h=River, 8h=Ocean, 10h=Magma, 20h=Slime, 40h=has MCCV

10h      uint32          nDoodadRefs;
14h      uint32          ofsMCVT;                           // offsets to various chunks. Relative to the beginning of the MCNK Chunk

7Ch      uint32          unused;                            // currently unused
```

About the holes in the terrain: This is a bitmapped field, the least significant 16 bits are used row-wise in the following arrangement with a 1 bit meaning that the map chunk has a hole in that part of its area:

```
0x1     0x2     0x4     0x8
0x10    0x20    0x40    0x80
0x100   0x200   0x400   0x800
0x1000  0x2000  0x4000  0x8000
```

### MCVT Subchunk

| Identifier | Length    |
| ---------- | --------- |
| MCVT       | 580 bytes |

These are the actual height values for the 9x9+8x8 vertices. 145 floats in the following order/arrangement:. The values in here are only relative to the position given in the corresponding MCNK chunk.

```
  1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9

WoW uses Squares out of 4 of the Outer(called NoLoD)-Vertices with one of the Inner(called LoD)-Vertices in the Center:

```

```

### MCNR Subchunk - Normals

| Identifier | Length                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| MCNR       | 435 bytes + 13 bytes of unknown data |

9x9 + 8x8 surface normals, laid out as in the MCVT chunk.

```
int8[3] normal;         // normalized. X, Y, Z. 127 == 1.0, -127 == -1.0.
```

This chunk has 13 bytes of unknown data at the end. The chunk size only covers the normals, though.

***
### MCLY Subchunk - Texture Layers

| Identifier | Length                |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| MCLY       | 1-4 layers * 16 bytes |

These are texture layer definitions for this map chunk. 16 bytes per layer, up to 4 layers. Every texture layer other than the first will have an alpha map to specify blending amounts. The first layer is rendered with full opacity. To know which alphamap is used, there is an offset into the MCAL chunk. That one is relative to MCAL.
You can animate these by setting the flags. Only simple linear animations are possible. You can specify the direction in 45° steps and the speed.
The textureId is just the array index of the filename array in the MTEX chunk.
The effectId links to GroundEffectTexture.dbc. It defines the little detaildoodads as well as the footstep sounds and if footprints are visible.

```
00h      uint32          textureId;
04h      uint32          flags;
08h      uint32          offsetInMCAL;
0Ch      int32           effectId;    // (actually int16 and padding)
```

**Flags**

```
Flag     Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0x001    Animation: Rotate 45° clockwise.
0x002    Animation: Rotate 90° clockwise.
0x004    Animation: Rotate 180° clockwise.
0x008    Animation: Make this faster.
0x010    Animation: Faster!!
0x020    Animation: Faster!!!!
0x040    Animation: Animate this texture as told in the other bits.
0x080    This will make the texture way brighter. Used for lava to make it "glow".
0x100    Use alpha map - set for every layer after the first
0x200    Alpha map is compressed
```

***
### MCRF Subchunk

| Identifier | Length   |
| ---------- | -------- |
| MCRF       | variable |

A uint32 list of with MCNK.nDoodadRefs + MCNK.nMapObjRefs indices into the file's MDDF and MODF chunks, saying which MCNK subchunk those particular doodads and objects are drawn within. This MCRF list contains duplicates for map doodads that overlap areas.
As both, WMOs and M2s are referenced here, they get doodad indices first, then WMOs. If you have a doodad and a WMO in the ADT as well as the MCNK, you will have a {0,0} in MCRF with nDoodadRefs and MCNK.nMapObjRefs being 1.

***
### MCSH Subchunk - Shadows

| Identifier | Length    |
| ---------- | --------- |
| MCSH       | 512 bytes |

Shadow map for static shadows on the terrain. Can be left out with the chunk&1 flag not set.
The shadow maps work as follows: the shadows are stored per bit as 0 or 1 (off or on) so we have 8 bytes (which equates to 64 values) X 64 bytes (64 values in this case) which ends up as a square 64x64 shadowmap with either white or black. Note that the shadow values come LSB first.

***
### MCAL Subchunk - Alpha maps

| Identifier | Length                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| MCAL       | 0-3 layers * 2048 bytes |


These are alpha maps for additional texture layers beside the base layer. Each layer contains a 64x64 alpha map. There are 2 alpha values per byte, first 4 bits and second 4 bits. Results in 2048 bytes per layer.

***
### MCLQ Subchunk - Liquids

| Identifier | Length |
| ---------- | ------ |
| MCLQ       | ???    |

The size of the chunk is in the mapchunk header. The type of liquid is given in the mapchunk flags, also in the header.
**This information is old and incomplete as well as maybe wrong.**
The first two floats specify the minimum and maximum liquid height level. After them comes a 9x9 height map for the water with the following format per vertex:

```
0x00     int16    ?
0x02     int16    ?
0x04     float    height value
```

The unknown int values might be color or transparency info, or something entirely different... Most frequently they are 0.
Followed by 8x8 bytes of flags for every liquid "tile" between the 9x9 vertex grid. The value 0x0F means do not render. (the specific flag for this seems to be 8 but I'm not sure - but it fixes some places where there was extra "water" sticking into the rest of the scenery)
Finally, 0x54 bytes of additional data, no idea what it's used for.

***
### MCSE Subchunk - Sound emitters

| Identifier | Length |
| ---------- | ------ |
| MCSE       | ???    |

This is not well understood. Struct from WoWDev Wiki:

```
00h      uint32          soundPointID;
04h      uint32          soundNameID;
