### Localization strings numbering

This is the list of language/index used when reading string in dbc on in locales\_\* MaNGOS table. When reading a dbc, all string fields diplayed at client screen are localized if you use a non US/GB version of the client, to get the localized strings, you need to read one of the fields next to the English one.

Use this table to know which column to the right of the English one you have to read to see localized data.

Note that localization support in core/database support only 8 languages while dbc can support 16 languages.
