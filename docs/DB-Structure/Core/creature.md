#### position\_y

The Y position of the creature.

#### position\_z

The Z position of the creature.

#### orientation

#### spawntimesecsmin

The minimum respawn time of the creature in seconds.

#### spawntimesecsmax

The maximum respawn time of the creature in seconds.

#### spawndist

The maximum distance that the creature should spawn from its spawn point. Also controls how far away the creature can walk from its spawn point if its [MovementType](creature#MovementType) = 1.

| Value | Comment                       |
