# Bot Commands

There are many commands for bots..  Some of which are optional, and rarely needed.

Others, are sometimes carried out automatically.

Commands can be given 2 ways: /t BOTNAME <command> <options> etc. OR /p <command> <options> etc...

The first, gives the command to ONE bot.  The last gives the order to all bots in the party!
(so be careful how you give commands or they'll ALL drop that item you only intended one bot to drop!)

Some commands are 'switches' that you set and then leave it until you want to change it.

Of course the most important commands are ...

/t BOTNAME help (lists all the commands above and how they work. Except for the ".bot command" ones.)

/t BOTNAME gm check talent spec (Does a validity check on all talentspecs in the database, only works for GMs or higher)

Haha, now go check out all these commands you can use!
