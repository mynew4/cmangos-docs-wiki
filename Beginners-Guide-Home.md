# CMaNGOS Beginners Guide

This guide is designed to help you understand the basics of how CMaNGOS works and get on your way to building a server from the ground up. It is intended for absolute beginners who have no idea what they are doing; if that's not you and you just want a step-by-step guide to building a server then you may want to skip ahead to the [Installation Instructions](Installation-Instructions).

This guide will not show you how to _do_ anything directly but it should prepare you to follow the Installation Instructions with a little more knowledge and understanding of what is going on. To get started click on the "Introduction" link below.
